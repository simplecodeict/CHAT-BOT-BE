Overview

The Commonwealth Distance Learning programme is one of three Master’s programmes offered by the Commonwealth Scholarships Commission.

The Commonwealth Scholarship Commission in the UK (CSC) provides the UK government scholarship scheme led by international development objectives. It operates within the framework of the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship plan (CSFP) and offers a vivid demonstration of the UK’s enduring commitment to the Commonwealth. By attracting individuals with outstanding talent and identifiable potential from all backgrounds and supporting them to become leaders and innovators on returning to their home countries, the CSC’s work combines sustainable development with the UK national interest and provides opportunities for international partnerships and collaboration.

Purpose: Funded by the UK Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO), Commonwealth Distance Learning Scholarships enable talented and motivated individuals to access training and skills required for sustainable development not available in their home countries.

Intended beneficiaries: Commonwealth Distance Learning Scholarships are for candidate from eligible low and middle income Commonwealth countries, to undertake part-time taught Master’s study with UK universities while remaining in their home countries.

Applications to the CSC must be made using the CSC’s online application system. 

The CSC is unable to accept any applications or documentation not submitted via the online application system. 

Applicants must apply and secure admission to study an approved Master’s course at a participating UK university in addition to applying for a Commonwealth Distance Learning Scholarship via the CSC’s online application system. Applicants can apply for more than one course and to more than one university, but they may only accept one offer of a Commonwealth Distance Learning Scholarship. Please note that Commonwealth Distance Learning Scholarships are only for Master’s courses and not for undergraduate or PhD study.  

Please check with the chosen university for their specific advice on when to apply, admission requirements, and rules for applying. 

Commonwealth Distance Learning Scholarship applications will be shared with UK universities, who will nominate their chosen applicants to receive a Commonwealth Distance Learning Scholarship in May 2024. The CSC will then check that the applicants who have been nominated meet the CSC’s eligibility criteria. Universities will inform applicants if they have successfully been awarded a Commonwealth Distance Learning Scholarship in July 2024.

Scholarships are tenable at any approved UK university or higher education institution with which the CSC has a part-funding agreement for a specific programme of study. For the full list, see here: cscuk.fcdo.gov.uk/uk-universities

Scholarships are to obtain one degree; funding will not be extended to enable candidates to complete a qualification in addition to or higher than that for which the selection was made.

Scholarships are made in respect of full-time study only and no other course of study may be undertaken at the same time.

The CSC does not provide new direct financial or promotional support for the fossil fuel energy sector overseas, defined as the extraction, production, transportation, refining and marketing of crude oil, natural gas or thermal coal, as well as any fossil-fuel fired power plants.

The CSC funds one-year taught Master’s programmes only and does not fund MBA degrees.

Applicants must make clear in the application which qualification they are applying for. This will enable the CSC to consider the application in the correct category. Applications which do not make this clear may be considered ineligible.

Applicants are advised to list three universities and courses that they think are the most appropriate for their study, in order of preference, and to explain their reasons. This is important because the CSC will not change the university or course (or the order of preference) of a provisionally selected candidate after the point of selection, unless exceptional information becomes available that could not have been foreseen at the time of application.

The CSC will make the final decision on institution of study, and reserves the right to overrule any preferences indicated by the applicant. The CSC will consider the suitability of the course and its value for money when deciding on any overrule.

Applicants must take the necessary steps to apply for admission to their preferred universities in advance of their scholarship application. Many courses have strict admission deadlines and candidates should check admission requirements carefully when applying. If an applicant is selected for a scholarship and has not applied and been accepted for a course, it may not be possible to proceed with the scholarship.Financial assistance

Each scholarship provides:

Approved airfare from the Scholar’s home country to the UK and return at the end of the award (the CSC will not reimburse the cost of fares for dependants, nor the cost of journeys made before the award is confirmed).
Approved tuition fees: full fees are covered by agreement between the CSC and the UK university, and Scholars are not liable to pay for any part of the tuition fee.
Stipend (living allowance) at the rate of £1,347 per month, or £1,652 per month for those at universities in the London metropolitan area (rates quoted at current levels).
Warm clothing allowance, where applicable.
Study travel grant towards the cost of study-related travel within the UK or overseas.
If a Scholar has children and is widowed, divorced, or a single parent, child allowance of child allowance of £576.61 per month for the first child, and £143 per month for the second and third child under the age of 16, if their children are living with them at the same address in the UK.
If a Scholar shares that they have a disability, a full assessment of their needs and eligibility for additional financial support will be offered by the CSC.

The CSC’s family allowances are intended to be only a contribution towards the cost of maintaining a Scholar’s family in the UK. The true costs are likely to be considerably higher, and Scholars must be able to supplement these allowances to support any family members who accompany them to the UK.General conditions
A Commonwealth Scholarship covers fees, approved fares, and personal maintenance. Other scholarships, awards, or bursaries that cover the same costs may not be held concurrently.

For the CSC to administer the application effectively and efficiently after submission, it will be necessary to create a record in the applicant’s name. If they apply for an award to the CSC, their details will be kept on file. Basic anonymised demographic data for all applicants will be kept for analytical research. The CSC is committed to protecting personal information and to being transparent about the information we are collecting about applicants and what we do with it. To find out more, see our privacy notice.

Applicant’s personal information will be used to conduct necessary due diligence checks to CSC’s satisfaction, before CSC proceeds with any type of formal agreement or contractual relationship. In most cases, the due diligence checks will be straightforward, however further information may be requested, so we ask for full co-operation to speed up the process.

If a candidate does not agree to personal data being used for the purpose of conducting due diligence, unfortunately CSC will not be able to proceed further with the application process.

If an application is successful, the CSC will notify the applicant that they have been provisionally selected (selected for an award subject to the CSC agreeing terms of admission to the university) at which point they will be a provisional scholarship candidate.

The CSC does not require any candidates to take an IELTS (English language) test.

The CSC will not be able to offer a scholarship if it would contravene the terms and conditions of another scholarship previously held.

When terms of admission to the university have been agreed, the CSC will provide a Notification of Award (formal offer of a scholarship).

When all conditions of the Notification of Award have been met, the CSC will provide a formal Confirmation of Award.

Candidates will be required to submit a Health and Disability Form before the Confirmation of Award can be issued.

Candidates will be required to sign an undertaking to return to their home country as soon as possible after the end of the award.

Candidates are expected to start the award on the date stated in the Notification of Award.

If a candidate requires a Student visa to come to the UK to study, they must meet all relevant immigration requirements set by UK Visas and Immigration. They should check the GOV.UK website for updated information.

All UK immigration regulations are set by UK Visas and Immigration and are subject to change. The CSC has no control over these regulations.

Candidates will be selected for an award based on the plan of study outlined on the application form, which is not expected to change significantly during the award. Any such changes must be agreed by the CSC.

Throughout the award, Scholars are expected to reside in the UK, and must to seek approval from the CSC in advance of any overseas travel.

Scholars must not undertake paid employment during the award without approval from the CSC in advance.

An award may be terminated at any time for reasons of unsatisfactory conduct, progress, or attendance, or if registration is suspended or terminated by the university for any reason.

The CSC is committed to administering and managing its scholarships and fellowships in a fair and transparent manner. For more information, see the CSC Anti-Fraud Policy and Procedure at and the FCDO guidance on reporting fraud.

The CSC is committed proactively to safeguard and promote the welfare of our beneficiaries, and to protect its staff, Commissioners, beneficiaries and all those with whom the CSC comes into contact.

The Commonwealth Shared Scholarship programme is one of three Master’s programmes offered by the Commonwealth Scholarship Commission.

The Commonwealth Scholarship Commission in the UK (CSC) provides the UK government scholarship scheme led by international development objectives. It operates within the framework of the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan (CSFP) and offers a vivid demonstration of the UK’s enduring commitment to the Commonwealth. By attracting individuals with outstanding talent and identifiable potential from all backgrounds and supporting them to become leaders and innovators on returning to their home countries, the CSC’s work combines sustainable development with the UK national interest and provides opportunities for international partnerships and collaboration.

Purpose: To contribute to development needs of Commonwealth countries by providing training for skilled and qualified professionals and academics who would not otherwise have been able to study in the UK.​

Intended beneficiaries: High-quality postgraduate students from Least Developed and middle-income countries (including fragile and conflict affected states), who have not studied for a year or more in a high-income country before, who would not otherwise afford to study in the UK, and who have the potential to enhance the development of their home countries with the knowledge and leadership skills they acquire.

Award duration: normally 12 months

Application process: UK universities bid for scholarships for specific courses with demonstrable development impact and must agree to fund the living cost component of the scholarships. Applications are made via successful universities, which make the initial selection of candidates, who are subsequently approved by the CSC.

This scholarship will not support a period of study at the home country university, the funding for which applicants are responsible themselves. Funding will not be extended to enable applicants to complete a qualification in addition to or higher than that for which the selection was made, nor for study towards a PhD at a UK institution.

Scholarships are made in respect of full-time study only and no other course of study may be undertaken at the same time.

The 12-month period of study in the UK supported by the scholarship can be divided into a maximum of two periods of study. If divided into two periods, a maximum of 12 months between periods in the UK is permitted. Usually, Scholars would be expected to spend a period of at least 6 months in their home country between visits to the UK. If less than 6 months is required between visits, further justification as to why this would be beneficial will be required in the study plan.

The CSC would not normally fund a Split-site Scholarship during the first 6 months of PhD registration, to ensure the direction of the PhD has already been established in conjunction with the home supervisor. If applying for a scholarship within the first 6 months of the PhD registration, applicants will need to justify why this would be beneficial in the study plan. Otherwise, the 12-month period of study in the UK can be taken at any stage during the PhD study.

Where applicants have not already started the PhD at the time of application, they will only be eligible to spend a maximum of six months in the UK in the first year of study.

Split-site scholarships are intended to provide access to specific expertise and equipment which would not otherwise be available in the applicant’s home country. Applications clearly demonstrating the specific value of studying in the UK to the research will be looked upon favourably, as well as those which demonstrate how the work will support ongoing research links. Applications including a significant proportion of activity such as literature reviews or desk research are unlikely to be supported.

The CSC will make the final decision on institution of study and reserves the right to overrule any preferences indicated by the candidate. The CSC will consider the suitability of the course and its value for money when deciding on any overrule. The CSC will not change the university of a provisionally selected candidate after the point of selection unless exceptional information becomes available that could not have been foreseen at the time of application
Financial assistance

Each scholarship provides:

Approved airfare from the Scholar’s home country to the UK and return at the end of the award (the CSC will not reimburse the cost of fares for dependants, nor the cost of journeys made before the award is confirmed).
Approved tuition fees: full fees are covered by agreement between the CSC and the UK university, and Scholars are not liable to pay for any part of the tuition fee.
Stipend (living allowance) at the rate of £1,347 per month, or £1,652 per month for those at universities in the London metropolitan area (rates quoted at current levels).
Warm clothing allowance, where applicable.
Study travel grant towards the cost of study-related travel within the UK or overseas.
If a Scholar is widowed, divorced, or a single parent, child allowance of £576.61 per month for the first child, and £143 per month for the second and third child under the age of 16, if their children are living with them at the same address in the UK.
If a Scholar shares that they have a disability, a full assessment of their needs and eligibility for additional financial support will be offered by the CSC.

The CSC’s family allowances are intended to be only a contribution towards the cost of maintaining a scholar’s family in the UK. The true costs are likely to be considerably higher, and Scholars must be able to supplement these allowances to support any family members who accompany them to the UK.

For more information, see the current Handbook for Commonwealth Scholars.

Please note that the conditions outlined in the Handbook are subject to change.
General conditions
A Commonwealth Scholarship covers fees, approved fares, and personal maintenance. Other scholarships, awards, or bursaries that cover the same costs may not be held concurrently.

For the CSC to administer the application effectively and efficiently after submission, it will be necessary to create a record in the applicant’s name. If they apply for an award to the CSC, their details will be kept on file. Basic anonymised demographic data for all applicants will be kept for analytical research. The CSC is committed to protecting personal information and to being transparent about the information we are collecting about applicants and what we do with it. To find out more, see our privacy notice.

Applicant’s personal information will be used to conduct necessary due diligence checks to CSC’s satisfaction, before CSC proceeds with any type of formal agreement or contractual relationship. In most cases, the due diligence checks will be straightforward, however further information may be requested, so we ask for full co-operation to speed up the process. 

If an applicant does not agree to personal data being used for the purpose of conducting due diligence, unfortunately CSC will not be able to proceed further with the application process. 

If an application is successful, the CSC will notify the applicant that they have been provisionally selected (selected for an award subject to the CSC agreeing terms of admission to the university) at which point they will be a provisional scholarship candidate.

The CSC does not require any applicants to take an IELTS (English language) test.

The CSC will not be able to offer a scholarship if it would contravene the terms and conditions of another scholarship previously held.

When terms of admission to the university have been agreed, the CSC will provide a Notification of Award (formal offer of a scholarship).

When all conditions of the Notification of Award have been met, the CSC will provide a formal Confirmation of Award.

Candidates will be required to submit a Health and Disability Form before the Confirmation of Award can be issued.

Candidates will be required to sign an undertaking to return to their home country as soon as possible after the end of the award.

Candidates are expected to start the award on the date stated in the Notification of Award.

If a candidate requires a Student visa to come to the UK to study, they must meet all relevant immigration requirements set by UK Visas and Immigration. They should check the GOV.UK website for updated information.

All UK immigration regulations are set by UK Visas and Immigration and are subject to change. The CSC has no control over these regulations.

Candidates will be selected for an award based on the plan of study outlined on the application form, which is not expected to change significantly during the award. Any such changes must be agreed by the CSC.

Throughout their award, Scholars are expected to reside in the UK, and must seek approval from the CSC in advance of any overseas travel.

Scholars must not undertake paid employment during the award without approval from the CSC in advance.

Collaboration is a feature of doctoral research. The CSC expects that participants in collaborative projects will develop a collaborative agreement to clarify the contributions and rights of each partner. The CSC will not get involved in negotiating an exploitation agreement but will need to be assured that an arrangement acceptable to all parties exists. Arrangements should be made to identify, protect, and value any arising intellectual property and to secure a suitable return to the institution and the investigators through exploitation. The CSC considers the intellectual property ownership to lie initially with the student; however, many universities have their own locally applicable policy. In many cases, it is in the best interest of a student for ownership to be vested with the university, which will have greater negotiating powers and will be likely to be able to seek the best returns in any exploitation agreement. Award holders are expected to notify the CSC when CSC-funded intellectual property is exploited.

The CSC will consider a request to extend a Scholar’s leave to remain in the UK after their award only if they wish to move from Master’s to PhD study. Strict conditions will apply.

The CSC cannot provide a letter of support or permission for Scholars to remain in or return to the UK after the award to enable them to work or undertake postdoctoral study.

The following are not eligible to apply for a Commonwealth Scholarship or Fellowship; an employee, a former employee, or relative of an employee of the Government of the United Kingdom; or a staff member of the Association of Commonwealth Universities or the British Council; or a Commonwealth Scholarship Commissioner, former Commonwealth Scholarship Commissioner or a relative of a Commonwealth Scholarship Commissioner. Former employees of the organisations listed above are eligible to apply three years after ceasing their employment with them.

In line with the UK Bribery Act 2010, any applicant convicted of bribery will be banned from reapplying for a Commonwealth Scholarship or Fellowship for a period of up to five years.

Applicants are expected to adhere to the CSC’s Code of Conduct for award holders and the Disciplinary Policy and Procedure.

An award may be terminated at any time for reasons of unsatisfactory conduct, progress, or attendance, or if registration is suspended or terminated by the university for any reason.

The CSC is committed to administering and managing its scholarships and fellowships in a fair and transparent manner. For more information, see the CSC Anti-Fraud Policy and Procedure at and the FCDO guidance on reporting fraud.

The CSC is committed proactively to safeguard and promote the welfare of our beneficiaries, and to protect its staff, Commissioners, beneficiaries and all those with whom the CSC comes into contact. The CSC requires staff, members of the Commission, applicants for and recipients of CSC awards and suppliers to act consistently with its requirements for safeguarding. Applicants should note the CSC Safeguarding Policy which sets out the obligation for staff, members of the Commission, applicants for and recipients of CSC awards, and suppliers to act consistently with its requirements for safeguarding. Any safeguarding concerns should be reported to the Commission at: csc.safeguarding@cscuk.org.uk

All conditions of award are subject to UK local law and practices and are subject to change by the CSC.

For more information, see the current Handbook for Commonwealth Scholars. Please note that the conditions outlined in the Handbook are subject to change

Kennedyallee 50, 53175 Bonn How To Apply For University In UK

So, you’ve decided to study in the UK. This wasn’t difficult for you to decide, but now you have reached the tricky part – how do you apply to a university in the UK? Understanding what higher education institutions in the UK require before you start the application process is important. 

Here is the application process for studying in the UK:

1. Choose a University and a Study Program
The first thing you need to do is define your target: what do you want to study, and where do you want to study. Fortunately, there are countless options available to you as the UK currently counts around 200 recognized higher education providers, whereas the variety of available study courses is larger than that.

Some of the top UK universities are global leaders in teaching and research. These courses are under regular review and modification in relation to cutting-edge educational reforms and global scientific improvements.

That said, this large variety assures you that something will certainly suit you regardless of your interests or academic preferences in the UK. But on the other hand, picking up the best deal from this variety may be time-consuming if you don’t have clear goals about what you want to study and what you want to achieve with your degree.

Here is what you can do to decide on a university: 

Make a list of your choices. List all universities that offer degree courses in your field of interest and check their course structure and modules to see if it matches your preferences.
Shortlist universities. It is not necessary to limit yourself to only one university. However, it would be much better than dispersing your attention among multiple options. Make a shorter list of universities to help narrow your options to only a few universities that best suit your needs. To carry on this research, you must start early enough, at least one month before application deadlines. 
Surroundings. Before choosing a university, check the location and decide whether you want to live near campus or in rural areas. Furthermore, you need to decide on the neighbourhood, check for public transportation and other things you need to consider. 
2. Meet the Application Requirements
After deciding what UK college and program you want to study, you must check the requirements. Most universities in the UK list their requirements on their website for each degree level and course. Knowing that UK college application requirements change largely between universities and courses, it is highly recommended you check multiple times and take notes if needed. Also, you must pay attention to the details because everything matters at this point in your application process. 

It is important to check what documents you need to submit, and here are some of the documents most universities require:

Passport or any other admissible form of identification.
Academic transcripts and study plans. 
Previously obtained diplomas. 
English proficiency certificates (TOEFL/IELTS/PTE Academic/or other exams if admissible).
Personal statement/letter of motivation. 
Reference and recommendation letters (from previous professors or employers). 
CV and portfolios (if applicable in certain courses).
Research proposal (for Ph.D. studies). 
Enrollment confirmation. 
Previously obtained visas.
Timing is also important at this stage due to the fact that gathering all required documents can take time, and there may be unexpected delays with the institutions in charge of releasing such documents. 

Consequently, you may lose the upcoming application deadline, and even worse, you can submit an application but get rejected for missing documents. Start to prepare well in time, at least three months before the university opens calls for available places.

Important: Preparing and undertaking a language proficiency course takes at least two months. Meanwhile, you have to complete the rest of your application simultaneously.

3. Apply
It is finally time to submit your application. Before doing that, give a final look at your application paperwork to see if you have gathered all the necessary documents. Once you have double-checked everything, you are ready to apply for a place at your chosen university/college in the UK. 

Applications are most of the time carried out online through the UCAS online application platform.

Here is a step-by-step guide on how to apply for a university course in the UK:

Register with the UCAS online application platform and create a personal account. 
Fill in your application form by selecting the course you are applying for.  
Write your personal statement (explaining why you are interested in this specific course).
Include a written reference/recommendation. 
Submit your application. 
Note that: Some universities run their own online application platform and may require you to apply through it or jointly with UCAS.

Application Deadlines 
There are different application deadlines for students who wish to study in the UK, depending on their nationality, degree level, and study program. 

Here are the most common deadlines for universities in the UK:

October. This deadline is designated only for the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge, specifically for applicants of medicine, veterinary medicine, science and dentistry. 
January 15. Most undergraduate courses in the UK have set this deadline. 
March. Designated for applicants of art and design courses.
June 30. Late deadline. Applications submitted after this deadline will rarely be accepted. 
Remember: You should apply as early as possible, especially if you need to obtain a visa, find accommodation, and make other arrangements. 4. Wait for the Admission Letter
As soon as your university receives your application, they will email you to confirm it. There’s not a regular period of time it takes the admission committee to review your application paperwork and respond. 

Due to UK universities’ heavy application load, it takes time to process your request. Overall, this process may take several weeks, depending on how many applications the university has received during that application term. 

The good news is you can track your online application processing through UCAS any time you want. UCAS will contact you with a response, and there are two possibilities: unconditional and conditional offers. The latter means you must complete certain subjects in your current studies or take a language proficiency test.  

5. Arrange Your Finances
As an international student, you must possess the proper financial means required to cover your studies and stay in the UK. The amount of money required in your bank account varies according to your circumstances.

This amount of money is calculated considering several factors, like the location of the university you’re willing to attend or the length of your course. For example, if your university is located in London, you must have at least £1,200 per month. Overall, you should expect to spend at least £1,000 monthly on living expenses in the UK.

The time between your application’s submission and the university’s admission notice is an opportunity for you to tackle financial issues, but to be well in time for upcoming procedures, we suggest you start as early as possible.

 Lucky for you, there is plenty of available financial aid in the UK for international students.

6. Get Your Student Visa
All nationalities except for citizens of Ireland need a student visa to study in the UK. The student visa in the UK is labelled as TIER 4 (General). The day you are given a place at the university, you must reach the British embassy to seek guidance on student visa requirements in the UK.

Attached with the admission letter, your university will send you a reference number known as Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS). You will need this number at the British embassy to prove that you have been awarded a place at a UK college and therefore are eligible for a student visa.

Due to the risk of student visa processing delays, you need to know what are the requirements for a student visa in the UK before you receive the admission letter.

Check the student visa requirements to understand what documents you need to submit in order to study in the UK.
UK Scholarships for International Students

International students nowadays follow the unspoken rule that implies the higher the quality of education, the higher the price. UK universities are a perfect sample of such a formula. They are consistently ranked among the world’s best universities for the quality of education but are some of the most expensive to afford at the same time.

But, allow yourself to get excited because there are many UK scholarships for international students, which you can obtain to tackle your financial concerns quickly.

First, you must know what to expect while studying in the UK. Following a governmental decision in 2017, UK universities can charge their home students tuition fees capping at €9,250 per academic year (the highest that ever existed at UK universities).

Meanwhile, the UK charges non-UK students a lot higher tuition fees which in some particular courses range up to over £50,000 per academic year. If you’re an EU student, you can use the benefits of student loans, but if you’re a non-EU and non-EEA student, financial help is needed.

And when finally adding the cost of living in the UK, a scholarship becomes necessary.

Here are the two major UK scholarships options for international students:

Governmental Scholarships

*Note: Many universities have established UK scholarship programs for international students. If your chosen university is not listed in this article, you should contact them directly to check if they offer such programs. 

Application Requirements
The application process for UK scholarships for international students does not contain a standard set of documents. Your scholarship application paperwork depends on factors like the type of scholarship you’re pursuing or the institution or organization that grants it.

Compared to governmental-funded scholarship requirements, each university sets specific requirements. As such, you should be aware of many variations regarding the criteria. 

Normally, the competition to get a scholarship in elite universities is fierce. Consequently, they may ask you to submit more documents than usual, so the assessing committee will have an easier job selecting the best applicants.

Therefore, before you continue with the application process, double-check the requirements. Surely you wouldn’t like to be in a situation where you get rejected because you failed to submit an essential application document.
UK Student Loans Guide 2024

UK student loans are nearly impossible to avoid, especially for international students. Considering higher education in the UK is quite expensive, you have the opportunity to apply for student loans and pay them back once you get a job. 

Tuition fees in the UK have been rising for years. A Government decision amended in 2017 allowed universities and other higher education providers to charge students a fee of £9,250 per year. 

Also, keep in mind that studying in the UK means you’ll have more expenses than just tuition fees. Even if you manage to get a scholarship, whether it’s a full one or not, you might still need to find a way to cover some of the costs yourself. It’s essential to plan ahead and be prepared for these potential expenses. 

The Government provides significant financial support to students who struggle with funding through a well-established and flexible student loan system. Understanding this loan system is crucial because it can play a vital role in your education budget in the UK. This article will help you get a better grasp of it.

Eligibility Criteria for Student Loans
Before we get into the details, the first step is to see if you qualify for a student loan. 

Here are some qualifications that determine your eligibility for the fund:

University or College: The institution you plan to attend must be approved for student loans.
Course: The specific course you are enrolled in should be eligible for funding.
Prior Study: Depending on your previous education, there might be limitations on receiving loans for certain courses.
Age: Some student loan programs have age restrictions, so your age might affect eligibility.
Residency Status or Citizenship: Your eligibility could be influenced by your residency status or citizenship.
Make sure you meet these qualifications before proceeding with your student loan application.Check the University’s Eligibility
To be eligible for a student loan in the UK, you need to make sure that the government recognizes your university. Not all higher education providers have this recognition, which means they can’t award you an official degree, and you won’t be able to apply for a student loan there. Universities with official recognition are called “recognized bodies,” while those without it are called “listed bodies.”

Remember: this list can change, so it’s essential to check regularly if your university is on the list. If you can’t find it there, contact the Department of Education to confirm. 

If your university is not on the list, you won’t be eligible for UK student loans. Make sure to verify this to avoid any issues with your funding.

Check Your Course’s Eligibility
Just like universities, authorities need to evaluate courses to ensure they comply with education law regulations. Some courses may be offered at universities but are not officially recognized. 

If your study course is not on the list provided below, you won’t be eligible to apply for a student loan:A first degree, BA or BSc or Bed.
A foundation degree.
A certificate of Higher Education.
A diploma of Higher Education (DipHE).
A Higher National Certificate (HNC).
A Higher National Diploma (HND).
A postgraduate certificate of Education (PGCE).
Initial Teacher Training.
An integrated master’s.
A pre-registration postgraduate healthcare course.
Note that: part-time students must study at least 25% of a full-time course in each academic year to be eligible for a loan. This requirement is known as “course intensity.”

What If I Already Have a Degree?
In the UK, student loans are mainly given to students who are pursuing their first degree. This applies even if you previously funded your education by yourself. However, there are certain circumstances where you may still receive limited funding.

If you don’t have a degree, you can get limited funding under two circumstances:

If you change your study course.
If you drop out of a course but then decide to start it again.
On the other hand, if you already hold a degree, you can get limited funding in the following cases:

Foundation degree. If you have completed a Foundation degree, an HNC, or HND, and now you want to pursue an Honours degree.
Honours degree. If you have an Honours degree or a higher education qualification, but you start attending a part-time Honours degree in engineering, technology, or computer science.
Healthcare course. Students who have started a healthcare course on or after 1 August 2017 are also eligible for these funds. However, dental and hygiene students who began their courses before the 2018/19 academic year cannot access these funds.
Are There Any Age Restrictions?
Currently, there are no age restrictions to acquire UK student loans.

Eligibility Based on Your Residential Status or Nationality
As for nationality and citizenship, you are eligible to apply for a fund if you fit the following requirements:

You’re a UK citizen or have “settled status”.
You have been living in the UK for at least 3 years before starting your study course.
Also, you are eligible if you have one of the following residential statuses: 
Refugee.
Humanitarian protection.
EEA migrant employee.
Child of a Swiss national.
Child of a Turkish employee.
A stateless person, and you’ll start your course on or after 1 August 2018.
Other eligibility criteria include:

You’re from an EU country.
You’ve been living in the UK for 7 years, and you’re under 18.
You’re above 18 but have been living in the UK for at least 20 years or half of your life.
How to Apply for a Student Loan in the UK?
Once you’ve made sure you’re eligible for the student loan system, the next step is to apply for one. The Student Loans Company (SLC) is the organization responsible for providing loans to students in the UK. 

However, the application procedures vary depending on which country within the UK you are in. As of now, students in England can apply online, but those in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland have different application processes.

Most of the part-time and full-time students in England have to follow the steps below:

Set up an online finance account.
Log in and complete the application form.
Submit household incomes if necessary.
Show identity proof if it’s required.
If you have any problems while applying, contact Student Finance England for help.

In other parts of the UK, the application process for student loans is different and not online yet. It can be a bit more complicated for different groups of students. 

For example, full-time and part-time students may need to provide different documents, and there may be specific requirements for EU nationals. 

Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland have their own Student Finance offices to assist students with UK student loans. 

To find out more, check the links below for each country’s information.

https://www.studentfinanceni.co.uk/ 

Types of UK Student Loans
Depending on where you plan to spend your money, there are two types of student loans: Tuition fee loans and Maintenance loans. 

Full-time student. If you’re a full-time student at a publicly-funded university and your course started on or after 1 August 2016, you can apply for a tuition fee loan. This loan is meant to cover the tuition and fees charged by your university. 
For public universities, you can get up to £9,250 per year; for private colleges or universities, it’s up to £6,165 per year. 

So, after a three-year course at a public university, you might have a debt of at least £27,000. The money is sent directly to your university to pay the fees.

Living expenses. On the other hand, if you need help with living expenses while studying in the UK, you can apply for a Maintenance loan. The amount you can borrow depends on where you live. 
For example, a student living in London away from home in the 2016/17 academic year could borrow up to £10,702, while those living away from home outside London could borrow up to £8,200. 

The money is usually paid into your bank account before each term.

Note that: When applying for a tuition fee loan, you may not have to show your household income. But for a maintenance loan, the Student Finance office will ask you to provide information about your household income from the previous tax year before the year you applied.

How Do I Repay?
Now comes the challenging part: paying the money back. Once you complete your degree and enter the job market, you’ll need to find a job. Only when your earnings reach a certain level will you begin the repayment phase.

There are three repayment plans based on your job earnings:

Plan 1 requires you to start repaying your debt when your yearly income exceeds £18,330.
If you earn over £25,000 per year, you can choose Plan 2. 
Plan 3 is for those whose income is over £21,000.
Keep in mind that student loans usually have an interest rate that varies for each repayment plan. The interest will be based on the RPI (Retail Price Index), which measures inflation in the UK regularly.

For further information concerning the repayment interest, we suggest you check this link:

http://www.slc.co.uk/students-and-customers/loan-repayment.aspx 

Is It Possible to Have My Loan Canceled?
There are some situations where you won’t have to pay back your tuition fees. These include if someone dies or can’t work anymore. Your debt might also be canceled if you can repay it within a certain time. 

Just remember, the student loan system can change, so these situations may change too.UK Tuition Fees 2023 Guide

UK tuition fees are high compared to other countries. However, one can justify the tuition fees considering the world-class quality that universities in the UK offer. Nevertheless, this might not be the case for everyone. Many talented students who dream of having a British degree usually give up because they think they cannot afford it. 

The UK tuition fees at UK higher education have constantly increased in recent years for resident and non-resident students. These changes are often made randomly, and universities decide separately. Consequently, a selective group of students can afford it, and the others usually move on to other destinations.

It has become a worldwide trend for the most well-known and reputed universities to carry higher tuition fees; the UK is no exception. From an economist’s perspective, that’s what you would expect.

Universities are searching for brilliant students, and on the other hand, students seek world-class universities to get the best out of their education and boost their future employability. This phenomenon encouraged universities to increase tuition fees.

What Determines the Cost of Your Degree in the UK?
The total amount of money you will need when securing a higher education provider in the UK depends on many factors. Although the tuition fees are high at most universities, finding a less expensive option is still possible. 

Here are the factors that impact the cost of studying in the UK:

Choosing the university. Firstly, it depends on the university you prefer, its reputation and location. Unlike countryside-based universities, universities in cities like London usually carry higher tuition fees. Furthermore, state-funded universities charge you with lower tuition fees than private universities. 
Degree level. Secondly, it depends on what level of higher education you’re enrolled in.  Since undergraduate studies usually last longer, it’s pretty typical to cost more than postgraduate studies. 
However, there are some unique courses in Bachelor’s programs where you can graduate with a Bachelor’s and Master’s degree simultaneously.

These programs are set up so the students won’t have to seek these two degrees separately, which would cost more and take longer. Instead, students would have the chance to finish their Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees before their peers who are attending traditional Bachelor courses.

Degree courses/programs. The tuition fees may also vary depending on the length of a course. For example, a medical degree may last longer than other study fields, costing more. Or there may be courses with mandatory laboratory courses for which you have to pay extra money to attend.
Nationality of the student. Last but not least, tuition fees depend on your nationality. If you’re a British citizen, the university will charge you lower tuition than international students. 
Similarly, EU students will be charged higher tuition fees after the final Brexit settlement in March 2019. Non-UK students have expressed concern about the increase in tuition fees in recent years.

How Much Does a Bachelor’s Degree Cost in the UK?
Did you know that in the UK, getting a Bachelor’s degree may cost more than a Master’s degree? If you have some general information about the UK tuition fees and their education system, this may seem like a no-brainer to you. 

At British universities, tuition fees were first introduced in 1998, requiring students to pay up to £1,000 per academic year. Since then, tuition fees have increased significantly and differently from place to place.

Tuition fees vary between the following 4 countries that comprise the UK: England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.

UK Tuition Fees at the Postgraduate Level

*If your course is a Laboratory-based program, you will have to pay higher tuition fees amounting to £16,222 per each academic year. 

At Clinical programs, you’ll have to pay £21,767; finally, in the MBA program, the tuition can amount to £18,914.

Part-Time and Full-Time Tuition Fees in the UK
Part-time postgraduate programs may seem to have lower tuition fees because semesters cost less compared to full-time semesters. But, knowing that a part-time master’s course takes longer to finish will cost more. This is the reason why many students are willing to choose fast-track study programs.

In fast-track programs, you can seek a Bachelor’s and a Master’s degree simultaneously. Instead of finishing a three-year traditional Bachelor’s program and then enrolling in a 2-year Master’s program —within only four years, you can graduate with both degrees. This way, you will reduce the number of semesters hence you’ll have to pay less for tuition fees.

The average tuition fee for part-time studies in the UK costs around £4,625 and £9,000 for full-time students per year.

Can I Take a Student Loan to Study in the UK?
International students who cannot afford to pay tuition fees in the UK can always apply for financial help from the UK government and universities. You can use many scholarships and student loan policies to cover fees.

In addition, you can also work part-time in the UK and full-time during the summer holidays. If you can work and/or get a scholarship/loan, it is fair to say that you may be able to handle UK tuition fees.

Currently, there are some scholarship programs that deliver financial support to international students, including the following: 

Chevening Scholarships
The Commonwealth Scholarships and Fellowships Plan and, 
Other scholarships for international students who want to study in the UK.
You can also apply for bank loans at Professional and Career Development Loans. You can borrow from £300 to as much as £10,000. A bunch of commercial banks and organizations offer scholarships for talented students. You just have to be at the right time and in the right place.

Important: If you are a native of a country with which the UK has a particular partnering agreement, the British university may offer reduced tuition fees to you. 

You can contact your country’s specific institutions that can help you cover tuition at a UK university. Said otherwise, there is a number of resources to fully or partially pay the UK tuition fees. Undergraduate Degree in the UK

Many international students dream of getting a bachelor’s degree in the UK. UK Universities are known and prestigious for their undergraduate degree programs.   

Getting your undergraduate degree in the UK is a great opportunity; therefore, people from around the world will opt to attend a British university for the whole duration of their college career. These universities offer thousands of excellent courses and grant degrees recognized worldwide by employers and academics alike.

Many people often consider undergraduate degrees bachelor’s degrees; in many cases, that is true. However, there are six types of undergraduate degrees you can earn in the UK.  

Note: At most UK universities, degrees are classified as either “Ordinary” or “Honours.” 

Ordinary or Non-Honours Degrees. They are typically awarded if all classes have been completed without a thesis. Usually, this will make no difference in terms of employment, but it may make a distinction in how you progress to postgraduate work. This isn’t the case for all universities, so if you are considering attending university in the UK, talk to those involved in admissions about how their degree distinctions work.
Honours Degrees. On the other hand, the honours degree means that the student successfully completed all undergraduate classes and a thesis.
Here are the types of undergraduate degrees in the UK:

Bachelor’s Degree in the UK (Baccalaureate or Undergraduate Degree)
One of the most common degrees in the UK, the bachelor’s degree, takes three or four years to complete depending on the subject and the study mode. More often than not, students usually study one subject in thorough detail. However, you can choose two subjects for your undergraduate degree, usually major and minor subjects. 

There are different types of bachelor’s degrees offered in UK universities, such as:

Bachelor of Arts (BA) 
Bachelor of Science (BSc) 
Bachelor of Education (BEd) 
Bachelor of Engineering (BEng)
Bachelor of Laws (LLB)
Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MB ChB)
Here are some of the programs that you could take when studying in the UK:

Anthropology and Archaeology.
Social Sciences (Sociology, Psychology, etc).
Classical History.
English (Literature, Linguistics, etc.).
Computer Science.
Business (Economics, Management).
Law.
Medical fields/Pre-Medical fields.
Music and Arts.
Engineering.
Philosophy.
Sciences (Earth Sciences, Biology, Chemistry).
Mathematics.
Theology and Religion.
Foundation Year (Foundation Diploma)
A foundation diploma is a connecting year between high school and an undergraduate degree. It is a one-year qualification designed for students who must be qualified to enter a bachelor’s degree. Consequently, students attend foundation year courses to prepare for further studies. 

Most universities and further education colleges offer a foundation year for those who are interested. The qualifications for a foundation year vary depending on the course and higher education institution. 

Foundation Degrees 
Compared to a foundation diploma, a foundation degree is the equivalent of a two-year bachelor’s degree with honours and usually takes two years to complete in a full-time study mode, whereas three to four years if you are studying part-time. 

If you opt to pursue a foundation degree, you will take classes related to your employment, similar to what some places would call an apprenticeship or an internship. After completing the foundation degree, you can either find a job or aim for a bachelor’s degree with an additional year —a so-called Top-up Degree.
Diplomas and Certificates of Higher Education
Like the two listed above, these certificates are equivalent to the first two years of a bachelor’s degree program, and they can lead to the third year.

Higher National Diploma (HND)
Another type of degree called a Higher National Diploma (HND) is similar to the foundation degree in the sense that it is a two-year certificate with a three-year option, but you must obtain good marks to qualify for the third year. To qualify for an HND, you must complete at least one or two A levels. 

Higher National Certificate (HNC)
Similar to the HND diploma, the higher national certificate takes one year to complete, and it is equivalent to one year of the university. It is designed for students who wish to train for a specific career or continue the second year of undergraduate studies. 

Certificate of Higher Education (CertHE)
The CertHE is meant to help you gain confidence in your ability to perform at the university level or to help you change careers or progress in your current career. With one to two years of study duration, the CertHE focuses on academic rather than practical learning. You can ask for a fast-track option to speed up your study duration to six months with the university’s permission. 

Diploma of Higher Education (DipHE)
The Diploma of Higher Education is considered the equivalent of a two-year bachelor’s degree and carries the same qualification as a Higher National Diploma. Like an HND, you can continue to complete the final year of a bachelor’s degree after completing a DipHE. 

Certificate of Continuing Education (CertCE)
The CertCe is considered a beginners’ class for those who wish to study for a part-time degree and test their skills at the undergraduate level. Students can continue their studies into the second year or until they get a full undergraduate degree. 

The CertCE usually offers 60 undergraduate degree credits, which is approximately half a year of undergraduate study. 

Master’s Degrees
Even though most people associate Master’s Degrees with postgraduate studies, some UK universities have added a specialized undergraduate Master’s Degree program to their curriculum. These programs are not incredibly common, but they are very appealing to many who were planning on going straight to postgraduate study after obtaining their first degree. 

These programs last four years and include what you would learn when obtaining your first degree; it combines your undergraduate and postgraduate degrees into one program. 

These programs can save student money because they require undergraduate tuition fees throughout the degree program. If this interests you, check with the universities you are considering attending and see if they have this program.

After the independence, with Sri Lanka’s endeavour  to develop many globally important 
economic, social, political and cultural relations, opportunities were created to exchange those 
relations with various foreign nations. As a result, avenues were also created to exchange 
educational and cultural opportu nities. As a consequence of globally disseminating the educational 
and cultural values of the respective countries by both the friendly nations and other foreign states, 
the students of this nation have received the privilege of travelling to foreign lands  and pursing 
studies in those countries.  To date, numerous foreign nations have extended scholarship 
opportunities to Sri Lankan students for both undergraduate and postgraduate  studies , and students 
are yielding maximum opportunities out of these scholars hip opportunities. Currently, there is a 
significant enthusiasm among students for foreign scholarships, and a substantial number of 
undergraduate and postgraduate degree opportunities are offered annually through the Ministry of

Scholarships are life-changing monetary funds for some students through which they are able to establish their careers successfully. No one can make an exception from it. In fact, every kind of student needs a scholarship or two, so they can completely concentrate on their studies without worrying about financial funds to pay for their school or college/university tuition fees. In this day and age, education has become a thing of money, and without money, it is not possible to earn a degree. With new advancements made in technology arise a new course. So to learn them, students have to pay or invest in lakhs which leads to applying for a massive educational loan and finally being in debt. But to repay the debt, it takes years of hard work and sacrifices. On the contrary, if a student studies on scholarships, he/she doesn’t have to repay the money, which is a not payable amount. But we can’t expect someone to pay for our education for free. We need to earn scholarships, which can be done through getting A grades and being exceptional in overall academics.Scholarships are the main encouraging factor for hard-working students to achieve their dreams. Scholarships for students are increasing each year as many universities and non-governmental organisations are coming forward to fund deserving students’ studies. Particularly scholarships for international students seem to be on the rise as many new scholarships emerge in the name of famous academicians who brought a change in their field. For example, there are many scholarships for Sri Lankans to Study abroad who have a hunger or quest to achieve more in their field.

We at AECC are happy to take responsibility for turning your abroad education dream into a reality. Contact AECC for further assistance!

Types of Scholarships for International Students

When it comes to scholarships for international students, there are a lot more options as abroad countries have categorised the scholarships into various types to suit different students’ needs. From a high-performing student to a financially weak student, everyone can receive scholarships according to their eligibility. To apply for these scholarships, students need to do extensive research, learn about these scholarships (eligibility, application open and deadline dates, the amount sponsored, applicable to which courses and degrees, etc.) and the application process.  It is mandatory to receive the proper scholarships at the correct time. So students should start their research in high school to prepare for their exams and score the needed grades or CGPA demanded by their desired universities.

Let us now see the types of scholarships available for international students.

Merit-based Scholarships - Merit-based scholarships are for meritorious students with exceptional academic records. But abroad, countries like the USA, the UK and Canada also consider excellency in extracurricular activities as an eligibility for receiving scholarships. So if you are a student with an impressive record in Sports, Music or active in Community Service, you are eligible for scholarships under the Merit-based type. 
The Fulbright Foreign Student Program by the US government is one of the Merit-based scholarships given to meritorious international students who want to study or perform research in the US for one or more years. The scholarship covers the full study cost of the students, including their tuition fees, textbooks cost, airfare costs, a living stipend and health insurance.
University Scholarships - Universities sponsor University scholarships to students who academically excelled in their high school or undergraduate degrees. It depends upon the degree they are applying to. Students who need University scholarships don’t need to apply for one separately. The University officials automatically choose the deserved students for the scholarships when students apply for admission specifying their grades. Both grades (academic performance) and extracurricular involvement are also considered like Merit-based scholarships.
The South Asia scholarship by the University of Dundee in London is one of the scholarships offered to students interested in pursuing education in the field of Forensic Science, Education, Medicine, Biomedical Science, Pharmacology and Pharmacy. The students are selected for scholarships by the University officials who analyse their academic performances in their relevant fields.
Country-specific Scholarships - Country-specific scholarships mean that students from developing countries are more focused and give attention to help them continue their higher studies in international countries. But these scholarships are only awarded to students with an excellent GPA or CGPA in their latest education degrees.
DAAD Scholarships for Development-Related Postgraduate Courses are one of the country-specific scholarships given to students from developing countries to do their post-graduate courses in Germany.
Government Scholarships - As the name explains, Government scholarships are the ones purely funded by the government of a country. International students can apply for foreign government scholarships if they seem eligible.
For example, the Chevening Scholarships given by the UK government are one of the good opportunities for international students to study at UK universities.
Private Scholarships - Private Scholarships are sponsored by Private organisations or by individual persons to support students’ passion for studying abroad. These scholarships are given to high-performing students so that they can continue their higher education in their particular field of interest in abroad universities. These scholarships are given to academically excellent and well-deserving students, and there is tough competition for these scholarships. Most of these scholarships are targeted toward minority groups, women, or students who choose specific areas of study.
 
Financial Scholarships - Financial scholarships are bursaries or need-based scholarships given particularly to financially weak students with impressive academic records. Sometimes students are selected based only on their financial status, given their academic performance is above average.

 1. Australia Awards  
The Australia Awards are prestigious international scholarships funded by the Australian Government 
that aim to contribute to the long -term development needs of Australia's partner countries, in line 
with global, bilateral and regional agreements.   The Australia Awards are a whole -of-government 
initiative bringing together scholarships administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade 
and the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR), offering the next generation of global leaders an opportunity to undertake study, research and professional development in Australia .
 
The Australian Government recognises tha t education develops skills and knowledge, builds enduring  
links between  people , nations, institutions  , and has the power to influence positive change. Australia  
Awards strive to develop leadership potential and stimulate lasting change by empowering a global network of talented individuals through high- quality education experiences in Australia and overseas. 
Recipients return home with new ideas and knowledge, and the ability to make a significant 
contribution to their home countries as leaders in their field.  
Australia Awards also demonstrate Australia's commitment to providing  equitable  education 
opportunities for individuals to enable their contribution to nati onal development outcomes and 
economic growth. For Australia, the Awards build an engaged and influential global network of leaders, advocates and change -makers and establish a network of ambassadors across the world.  
Australia Awards also contribute to the productivity of Australia and the development of people -to-
people links between Australia, our regional partners and the broader international community . 
1.1. Australia Awards Scholarships  
1.1.1.  Australia Awards Scholarships demonstrate Australia’s commitment to the 2030 Agenda on 
Sustainable Development. They aim to contribute to the long -term development needs of 
Australia's partner countries in line with Australia’s aid priorities and bilateral and regional agreements. They provide opportunities for people from developing countries to undertake full -time undergraduate or postgraduate study at participating Australian 
universities and Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institutions.  
 
1.1.2.  The Australian Government encourages equity for al l, without discrimination. Australia 
Awards Scholarships support study by people with disability and people from marginal or minority groups, and aim to empower women to participate in the economy, leadership 
and education.  
1.1.3.  The study and research opportuni ties provided by Australia Awards Scholarships develop 
the skills and knowledge of individuals to drive change and contribute to the development outcomes of their own country.  
1.1.4.  To ensure the development impact of Australia Awards Scholarships, all awardees must return home on completion of their studies so they can contribute to development in their country. Awardees are required to leave Australia for a minimum of two years after completing their scholarship. Failure to do so without prior approval from DFA T will result 
in the awardee incurring a debt  to the Commonwealth of Australia  for the total accrued 
cost of their scholarship.  Alumni  may seek a no objection letter from DFAT for any travel to 
Australia within this two -year period.

2.6.3.  Australia Awards Scholarships do not support completion of studies already commenced in Australia.   
2.6.4.  Australia Awards Scholarships do not support study for a lesser degree than one already held by the applicant.  
2.6.5.  {A} Applicants must read the relevant Country or Regional Profile or check with the nearest 
DFAT office (or the Managing Contractor’s office) to find out what courses are supported 
by an Australia Award. For example, some Program Areas do not provide scholarships for 
undergraduate or PhD studies.  
Bachelor’s degree  
2.6.6.  The maximum duration of study permitted for a Bachelor’s  degree is four years. 
Double Bachelor’s  degre es are permitted so long as both are included in the original 
offer and both can be completed within four years.  
2.6.7.  {I} Institutions may recommend an Honours year for an outstanding awardee 
undertaking a Bachelor degree by submitting a Course Transfer variati on in OASIS 
(refer Section 13.5.5 ). 
2.6.8.  {I} Institutions must seek approval from Program Areas before inviting an awardee to 
undertake an Honours program. Institutions should provide the awardee’s subject 
results when seeking  approval.  
2.6.9.  {I} Approval must be sought by the institution no later than three months before the 
awardee’s scholarship completion date, to allow time for the Program Area to assess 
the request and, where relevant, seek partner government approval.  
Master’s degree  
2.6.10.  The maximum duration for a Master’s  degree program is two years.  Where an 
awardee studying a Master’s  by Research returns to their home country before their 
final thesis is submitted, a written submission timeline ( agreed by the awardee ’s 
supervisor ) must be given by the awardee to their Student Contact Officer to be 
uploaded into OASIS.  The maximum duration to submit a thesis after returning home is two years . Awardees studying Master’s  by Coursework with a research component

Australia Awards Scholarships Policy Handbook April  2023  
(A) = applicant/awardee  (P) = Program Area  (I) = institution     (S) = Global Education and Scholarships Section  
 must submit their research before they return home, or their scholarship completion 
will be recorded as a fail.  
2.6.11.  Master’s  degree programs may be offered by coursework, by research or by a 
combination of coursework and research. Master’s  by research or a combination of 
coursework and research should be offered only to those applicants who have demonstrated the need for high- level research skills in order to undertake research or 
teaching or to supervise researchers upon their return home.  
2.6.12.  Double Master’s  degrees are perm itted only when both are included in the 
institution’s original offer and both courses can be completed within two years.  
2.6.13.  The only  exception to this  maximum duration  is the Master of Diplomacy  at the 
Australian National University  (ANU) , which the Asia – P acific College of Diplomacy at 
the ANU offers as part of double Master’s  degree program. The Master of Diplomacy is 
not offered as a stand- alone course and the double degree may take up to three years 
to complete .  Only applicants with a relevant background in diplomacy who will return 
to the original organisation at the completion of their scholarship will be considered for this course.  
2.6.14.  {A} Applicants wishing to undertake the Master of Diplomacy at the ANU as part of a 
double Master’s degree program must identify this course in their application form.  
Program Areas have discretion to approve or reject applications for the Master of 
Diplo macy subject to Program Areas’ budget and policy.  
2.6.15.  {P} If Program Areas support an awardee to undertake the Master of Diplomacy as 
part of a double Master’s program, Program Areas are required to record both courses 
in OASIS at the placement stage  with a co ndition of the awardee passing their first 
Master’s qualification with the required grade.  
2.6.16.  {A} Applicants wishing to undertake a Master’s by research must investigate an 
appropriate supervisor. Australian higher education institutions’ websites identify the 
institution’s areas of research strength. Applicants should supply evidence of past 
research undertaken and highlight outcomes.  
Doctorate programs  
2.6.17.  The maximum duration for a PhD is four years.   
 
2.6.18.  Where an awardee returns to their home country before submitting a  final thesis , the 
awardee must give a written submission timeline  (agreed by the awardees supervisor ) 
to their Student Contact Officer to be uploaded into OASIS.  The maximum duration to submit a PhD th esis after returning home is two  year s.  
2.6.19.  Study at doctorate level (PhD) may be subject to partner government approval. Normally, approval is given only where the applicant occupies, or is expected to occupy, a senior position requiring individual research or the supervision and training of other researchers in a research organisation (e.g. university or research centre) in 
the applicant’s home country.  
Articulated study programs  
2.6.20.  An articulated study program is one that combines a lower and higher -level course of 
study, leading to award of the higher qualification. Examples include a vocational

 4. Selection  
4.1. Selection process and criteria  
4.1.1.  All applic ations for Australia Awards are considered on merit providing equal 
opportunity to all applicants.  
4.1.2.  Program Areas manage the selection process in each country/region and the selection 
process is detailed in the relevant Country or Region Profile.  
4.1.3.  Australian government  must be represented on interview panels. The selection 
committee must be chaired by a DFAT officer,  (EL1 or APS6 ) or a ( DESE counsellor ) or 
an (A-based officer ) or (a representative from a country/regional desk ). The selection 
process must include an interview of short -listed candidates (approved by a senior 
DFAT officer at First Secretary level or above) and may include other activities such as group participation sessions to assess the suitability of applicants.  
 
4.1.4.  Selection of applicants will consider  the applicant’s professional and personal qualities, 
academic competence and, most importantly, their potential to impact on development challenges in their home country. Each country or region may have additional selection criteria, which can be accessed in the relevant Country or Region Profile (
http://dfat.gov.au/people -to-people/australia -awards/pages/participating -
countries.aspx ).  
4.1.5.  The table  below is a guide for applicants to understand how  Program Areas  might 
score an applicant.  
Program Area Score  Score Description  
Outstanding: greater than or equal 
to 90%  Outstanding application with a study program that has 
been very well developed in relation to its contribution to building leadership in support of home country’s development; an outstanding candidate with strong academic capacity and demonstrated leadership capacities in strategic and inspirational thinking and practice, who is very likely to make a significant impact in their field of 
practice in hom e country and internationally.  
Very good:  greater than or equal to 
80% and less than or equal to 89%  High quality application with a study program that has 
been well considered for its contributions to building leadership in support of home country’s development; a highly capable candidate who has demonstrated promising leadership capacities in strategic and inspirational thinking and practice, who is likely to make a significant impact in their field of activity.  
 
Good:  
greater than or equ al to 70% and 
less than or equal to 79% % Worthy application with a relevant study program; a 
capable candidate who has demonstrated some promising leadership characteristics and is likely to complete the study program and make a sound contribution to their  
field of activity.

Australia Awards Scholarships Policy Handbook April  2023  
(A) = applicant/awardee  (P) = Program Area  (I) = institution     (S) = Global Education and Scholarships Section  
 Satisfactory:   
greater than or equal to 60% and 
less than or equal to 69%  
 An adequate application with a relevant study program; a 
candidate that has demonstrated some initial leadership characteristics and is reasonably likely to complete the study program and contribute  to their field of activity.  
 
Limited:  
less than 60%  An application that has not been well thought through and 
has a high element of risk in relation to successful completion of the study program; a candidate with limited potential to contribute as a leader in their field of activity.  
 
4.1.6.  {P} Program Areas are re sponsible for selecting and awarding scholarships to the most 
suitable applicants. These are applicants who match the desired profile, who 
demonstrate a strong likelihood of succeeding in their studies and who will be able to 
contribute to leadership and d evelopment in areas being targeted by the development 
strategy. Applicants who demonstrate a significant ability to develop networks while in 
Australia and promote Australia in their home country on completion of their studies 
will be favourably considered. Further guidance on the undertaking of a  selection 
process is available in the ‘Australia Awards Scholarships Selections – Good Practice 
Note’ available in OASIS.  
4.2. Reintegration plans  
4.2.1.  Reintegration plans  (also known as Development Impact Plans or Re -Entry Action 
Plans)  are an effective tool to assist Program Areas, applicants, awardees and alumni 
at the selection, return -home and post -scholarship stages . Applicants must propose a 
reintegration plan as part of their application.  
4.2.2.  {A} The reintegration plan is a statement of intent by the applicant, setting out 
practical and realistic examples of tasks on which they plan to apply the skills and 
knowledge gained through their studies in  Australia and the possible constraints they 
think could prevent them from achieving these tasks and mitigation strategies to 
overcome challenges.  
4.2.3.  {A} Awardees may be required to update their reintegration plan at any stage of their 
scholarship, including as part of on- award enrichment training.  
4.2.4.  {P} Program Areas will include reintegration plans as part of the application and 
selection process and require all applicants to complete a reintegration plan to help 
selection panels identify which candidates have well thought through approaches for 
using their new skills on return to their home country.  
4.2.5.  {P} Program Areas may include the applicant’s/awardee’s employer as a party to the 
plan, particularly  where the employer is holding the awardee’s position open, and 
where there is a stron g human resource development priority for the Program Area’s 
Australia Awards Scholarships.  
4.3. Successful and reserve applicants  
4.3.1.  The Scholarship selection process in each country (or, in some cases, in the region) will result in a list of successful candidates equal to the number of scholarships available  
Page 38 of 148 
Australia Awards Scholarships Policy Handbook April  2023  
(A) = applicant/awardee  (P) = Program Area  (I) = institution     (S) = Global Education and Scholarships Section  
 for the country or region, and in most instances a list of reserve  candidates ranked in 
order.  
4.3.2.  Applicants will be advised of the outcome of their application  upon completion o f the 
Australia Awards Scholarships selection process (generally August) . 
4.3.3.  Successful candidates become awardees once the candidate has signed the 
scholarship contract with the Commonwealth of Australia  after a placement offer has 
been received from an Austr alian university.  
4.3.4.  {P} Scholarship numbers are determined by the budget available to fund them. If the 
opportunity arises, reserve candidates will be selected from high quality applicants 
who have not received an award if they meet all eligibility criteria and are deemed 
suitable for placement.  
4.4. Advising applicants of selection outcomes  
4.4.1.  {P} Program Areas will inform  applicants of the outcomes of their Australia Awards 
Scholarships selection process upon completion (generally August).

 5. Placement  
5.1. Request for pla cement and placement offers  
5.1.1.  After finalising awardee  selection, Program Areas  use OASIS to request placements for 
successful applicants at their first preference institution and course.  
5.1.2.  Requests for placement are assessed by institutions on merit. An insti tution  will 
process a placement offer only where the awardee meets the institution’s admission 
requirements (including English language requirements) and is assessed as being 
capable of successfully completing the nominated course within the specified peri od 
(as recorded on the CRICOS  website ). 
i. placements of awardees with disability, involve additional considerations and

5.1.3.  DFAT  reserves the right to reject a placement offer made by an institution or to 
withdraw a placement request . 
5.1.4.  {P} Program Areas must use OASIS to request placements. Requests sent outside 
OASIS may not be considered by institutions.  
5.1.5.  {P} Program  Areas will initiate requests for placement in OASIS by 25 August for first 
semester  commencement and by 15 March for second semester  commencement. 
Program Areas are to ensure that when submitting  a request for placement to an 
institution:  
i. it is compliant  with any country specific conditions set by the partner government, 
and  
ii. the following have been uploaded or recorded in OASIS:  
o properly certified supporting documentation,  
o the awardee’s emergency contact details,  
o the dependents’ information, where relevant,  
o the awardee’ s passport number and expiry date, and  
o statement of good character or police records check document  
iii. for PhD awardees, the following has been uploaded into OASIS:  
o the letter or email communication, as outlined at Secti on 2.8. 2 viii, from the

proposal, and  
o the supporting documents outlined at Section 2.8.2 . 
5.1.6.  {P} If the institution requests further information from the Program Area to process 
the request for placement, the Program Area  must respond promptly to enable the 
institution’s final response to the request for placement  to be sent in accordance with 
the timeframes outlined in  Section 5.1.6 . 
5.1.7.  {P} Placements involving periods of more than six weeks, where the awardee is not 
enrolled (excluding semester breaks), will not be approved. If a long period without 
study is unavoidable between pre -course English, foundation programs or articulated 
programs  and the main course of study, alternative options should be considered such 
as enrolment in summer or winter courses or suspension (refer Section 13.4 ).

(A) = applicant/awardee  (P) = Program Area  (I) = institution     (S) = Global Education and Scholarships Section  
 5.1.8.  {P} If an applicant’s first preference is declined by an institution, the Program Area  may 
approach the second institution. The second preference institution will process the 
request for placement in OASIS in line with the process above and the timeframe 
outlined in Section 5.1.11 – 5.1.15 . 
5.1.9.  {P} If a successful applicant cannot be placed in either of their preferred courses, the 
Program Area  must advise the applicant and where  relevant, their nominating 
authority, that no placement can be offered. In such circumstances, the Program Area  
will withdraw the scholarship offer.  
5.1.10.  {P} Program Areas will not attempt to negotiate with an institution to accept a 
scholarship holder who does not meet the institutions minimum requirement s. 
5.1.11.  {I} Institutions must respond to completed placement requests received in OASIS:  
i. within 15 business  days for coursework studies; and  
ii. within 30 business days for research studies.  
The institution may respond to a placement request in OASIS by:  
iii. declining to offer a place at the institution and stating the reasons why;  
iv. offering a place conditionally; and 
v. offering a place unconditionally.  
5.1.12.  {I} If the institution requires further information from the Program Area to process the 
placement, the institution must respond to the request for placement as soon as 
possible, to attempt to meet the timeframe at Section 5.1.6 . 
5.1.13.  {I} If the institution does not respond to a completed request within the stipulated 
timeframe the Program Area may withdraw the placement from that institution at its 
discretion.  
5.1.14.  {I} The institution should ensure placement offers include:  
i. the Introductory Academic Program (an example of an IAP is at Annex A);  
ii. the awardee’s nominated course (reflecting any  credit for previous study or 
recognition of prior learning that may reduce the length of time needed to complete 
the course);  
iii. any preparatory programs deemed necessary by the institution 
iv. any other compulsory courses or course elements (e.g. fieldwork, wor k attachments, 
first aid course, occupational health and safety course, etc.);

5.2.3.  {I} Institutions may recommend preparatory programs that run for up to a maximum 
of 12 months. The total program of activities (i.e. a combination of the preparatory 
programs and the main course of studies) must not result in the scholarship duration 
being more than 12 months longer than the main course.  
Foundation programs  
5.2.4.  A foundation progra m of up to 12 months may be offered by the institution to

the objectives of Australia’s aid program by supporting  the applicant to use  the 
knowledge and expertise acquired during their scholarship for capacity building in 
their home country.  
8.4.2.  To support this objective, Australian migration legislation has a number of provisions 
which combine to ensure that a visa applicant will leave Australia at the completion of 
their scholarship for a per iod of two years.

8.5.5.  {I} An institution must request the Global Education and Scholarships Section to 
provide a ‘No Objection Letter’ for a further visa when DFAT authorises a variation that 
permits the awardee to stay in Australia past their initial visa expiry date.  
8.5.6.  {I} The institution should make sure the passport details of the awardees and 
dependents (if any) are up to date in OASIS to enable DFAT’s issuance of a correct ‘No 
Objection Letter'.  
8.5.7.  {S} If the Program Area approves an extension to an awardee’s scholarship, the Global 
Education and Scholarships Section will provide a ‘No Objection Letter’ to allow the

(A) = applicant/awardee  (P) = Program Area  (I) = institution     (S) = Global Education and Scholarships Section  
 8.8.4.  Applications to undertake a second PhD will not be considered.  
8.8.5.  As the two -year exclusion  rule is a condition of the student visa, it will not  be waived 
but will be deferred  to commence once the awardee has completed the externally 
funded program. Any time an awardee spends in their home country before taking up 
the ex ternally funded program will be deducted from the two -year timeframe.  Any

Education and Scholarships Section to apply for a visa to return to Australia to 
undertake an externally funded program if  it is within the two -year exclusion period. 
This request should include:  
i. the original offer of a fully funded (including daily living allowance) PhD scholarship or 
post -doctoral fellowship for research/study. If the funding institution is different to the 
institution offering the study, then a letter of offer from both institutions must be 
submitted, demonstrating the proposed start date of study and full funding;  
ii. support  letter from academic supervisor ; 
iii. a statement justifying the  additional activity (i.e. the PhD program or the Post -doctoral 
Fellowship) based on relevance to the home country’s development priorities;  
iv. a support letter from the employer as evidence that they are likely to return to a

8.8.13.  {S} If the delegate approves the request, the awardee will be required to sign and 
return a deed of amendment to their initial contract with the Commonwealth of 
Australia to confirm their intention to return to their home country for the remainder 
of the two -year exclusion period.  
8.8.14.  {S} When DFAT receives the signed deed of amendment, it will provide the awardee

application.  
8.9.4.  {S} If the awardee is not willing or able to enter into a satisfactory repayment 
arrangement or DFAT determines that the awardee does not have the ability to repay

 9. Disability  inclusive support  
9.1. Support for people with disability  
9.1.1.  The Australian aid program has specific strategic goals relat ing to participation in 
society by  people with disability .  DFAT ’s Development for All 2015- 2020  strategy aims 
to ensure that people with disability are included in and benefit equally from 
Australia’s development assistance.  
9.1.2.  This commitment is  reflected in Australia Awards Scholarships, which take a person-
centred approach to providing disability inclusive support . DFAT  strives to ensure 
accessibility for people with disability throughout the scholarship process from 
application, through selection, pre -departure activities, the on -award experience, 
scholarship completion and alumni engagement.  
9.1.3.  All applicants, regardless  of ability are to be assessed equally, without discrimination.  
9.1.4.  All applicants and awardees with disability are to be supported to enable their 
participation in the Australia Awards on an equal basis with all other applicants and awardees.  
9.1.5.  Under Australia n law, disability includes physical, intellectual, psychiatric, sensory, 
neurological,  and learning disability, physical disfigurement, and the presence in the 
body of disease -causing organisms. More information on the Australian definition of 
disability a nd the rights of people with disability in Australia  is available on DFATs 
website and the  Australian Human Rights Commission’s website at  
https://www.humanrights.gov.au/our -work/dis ability -rights . 
9.2. Applicants with disability  
9.2.1.  People with disability who are otherwise eligible are encouraged to apply for an Australia Award.  They will be considered equally, on merit, against all other 
applicants.  
9.2.2.  {A} DFAT strongly recommends that applicants with disability:  
i. disclose their disability when lodging an application; and  
ii. communicate to Program Areas any adjustments or assistance they will need to attend 
and participate before attending a selection interview.  
9.2.3.  {P} Program Areas will:  
i. enco urage people with disability, who are otherwise eligible for an Australia Award, to 
apply;  
ii. ensure applicants with disability are equally able to access the application and 
selection processes by providing reasonable adjustments and additional assistance;  
iii. provide reasonable financial assistance to applicants with disability where this 
assistance is essential to facilitate their participation on an equal basis with other 
applicants; and  
iv. may consult with the DFAT Disability Support Consultant (in Canberra) for expert 
advice on specific requirements.   
Page 59 of 148 
Australia Awards Scholarships Policy Handbook April  2023  
(A) = applicant/awardee  (P) = Program Area  (I) = institution     (S) = Global Education and Scholarships Section  
 9.2.4.  All applicants for an Australia Awards Scholarship, including people with disability, are 
required to meet the eligibility criteria set out in  Sections 2.1 through 2.3 . 
9.2.5.  DFAT will always work in good faith to provide access to the Australia Awards Scholarships for people with disability. However, in some very rare cases, applicants may not be awarded a scholarship if the disability support required to enable their 
participation would impose an unjustifiable burden on the Australia Awards Scholarships program.   
9.2.6.  In order to ensure the success of applicants and awardees with disability, DFAT  
engages a Disability Support Co nsultant . This adviser assists DFAT  in developing a 
Disability Support Agreement in consultation with institutions, awardees and Program Areas to assess support needs and identify practical solutions to enable the successful selection and mobilisation of applicants and awardees with disability.  
9.3. Principles for providing disability support for awardees  
9.3.1.  DFAT will provide a Disability Administration Supplement of A $300 per awardee, per 
semester to institutions. This acknowledges the additional support Student C ontact 
Officers provide to awardees with disability compared to usual services provided to Australia Awards awardees .  
9.3.2.  Additional disability support includes implementation and ongoing management of the Disability Support Agreement, which includes financial management of funding provided by DFAT, the purchase and provision of DSA items, correct use of OASIS and, as required, sourcing accessible accommodation, additional welfare and critical incident assistance, support related to carers, etc.  
9.3.3.  This supplement only applies where institutions are managing awardees with active Disability Support Agreements; it will not be approved for an awardee with disability who has no Disability Support Agreement in place, i.e. has no requirement for DFAT funded reasonable accommodations to participate equally in their scholarships  
9.3.4.  The Disability Administration Supplement must form part of a DSA and is to be expensed in line with the Management Fee terms and conditions.  
9.3.5.  DFAT  and institutions will provide reasonable adjustment and accommodation to 
allow awardees with disability to participate in Australia Awards Scholarships  on an 
equal  academic  basis.  
9.3.6.  DFAT aims to enable awardees to develop disability management skills, greater independence and personal empowerment. These life -long skills assist awardees in 
Australia and beyond, increasing the awardee’s individual development impact.  
9.3.7.  Disability Support Agreements outline reasonable accommodations funded by DFAT. The capacity to provide reasonable a ccommodations is limited by an awar dee’s 
willingness to engage in the  disability support process  and disclosure of their needs 
and expectations.  
9.3.8.  Without exception, awardees with a disability will not be approved for mobilisation until a Disability Support  Agreement is uploaded to OASIS.  Program Areas will be 
required to defer an awardee if a Disability Support Agreement has not been developed, approved and uploaded to OASIS.

Australia Awards Scholarships Policy Handbook April  2023  
(A) = applicant/awardee  (P) = Program Area  (I) = institution     (S) = Global Education and Scholarships Section  
 9.3.9.  DFAT  remains flexible in the provision of reasonable  accommodations and will 
reas sess support needs throughout the scholarship period .  
9.3.10.  Standard scholarship entitlements,  such as establishment allowance, contribution to 
living expenses and supplementary academic support, must not be used to fund 
disability support. Additional funds for  disability support will be allocated as part of the 
Disability Support Agreement .  
9.3.11.  The Disability Support Agreement acts as an addendum to an awardee’s scholarship 
contract and does not change any of the obligations pursuant to the scholarship contract.  
9.4. Assessing disability support needs  
9.4.1.  The disability assessment process, in which all stakeholders are engaged, identifies reasonable accommodations and related disability support required to develop a Disability Support Agreement.  The costs of implementing a disability support 
agreement will not exceed 1.5 times the cost of the academic component of the scholarship.  
9.4.2.  Disability Support Agreements will  outline  the required level of support for pre -
departure, during travel and for living and studying in Australia.  
9.4.3.  The Disability Support Consultant will develop the Disability Support Agreement and submit it to Global Education and Scholarships Section for review and approval.  
Disability support process responsibilities  
9.4.4.  All parties must work  closely to ensure the best outcome for awardees with disability.  
9.4.5.  {A} Awardees  with disability will:  
i. engage with the Disability Support Consultant as early as possible in the process and 
while on scholarship work closely with the Disability Support Consultant. This 
consultant has been engaged by DFAT to provide expertise on the support of awardees 
with disability;  
ii. participate in the Disability Support Process by completing the Disability Support 
Statement and providing all relevant medical documents, which will result in a 
Disability Support Agreement;  
iii. note that the process of conducting Disability Support Processes will require DFAT to 
share information about an awardee’s disability and support needs with the relevant 
institution and relevant disability service providers. This information is bound by 
Australian privacy laws and will be disclosed only for the purpose of facilitating equal 
access to education for awardees with disability;  
iv. provide a full medical report (no more than two years old and in English, or a certified 
translation) that establishes the nature of the disability and required support in 
Australia. This is a requirement to assess the need for reasonable adjustments and 
acco mmodations and to ensure awardees with disability have adequate Overseas 
Student Health Cover;

(A) = applicant/awardee  (P) = Program Area  (I) = institution     (S) = Global Education and Scholarships Section  
 v. understand that developing Disability Support Agreements may take considerable time 
and their cooperation is essential to the efficient and effective implementa tion of 
reasonable adjustments and accommodations;  
vi. understand that without a Disability Support Agreement in place DFAT will be required 
to defer awardees with disability to a later scholarship start date. This is to ensure all 
necessary and appropriate reasonable adjustments and accommodations can be put in 
place;  
vii. understand a Disability Support Agreement can be reviewed at any stage of the 
scholarship;  
viii. where a carer is required, work with the Disability Support Consultant to develop a 
carers agreement an d have the carer sign the agreement; and  
ix. contact the Disability Support Consultant with any concerns regarding disability 
support while on- scholarship.  
9.4.6.  {P} Program  Areas will:  
i. facilitate the removal of barriers for applicants with disability during the se lection 
process;  
ii. apply fair and transparent practices when considering applications from people with 
disability and assess applications equally against all other applicants, without 
discrimination;  
iii. contact successful awardees with disability and explain the Disability Support Process, 
ensuring they understand their obligations to provide recent and relevant information 
about their disability and the support they may need in Australia;  
iv. provide all documents and contact information of awardees with disability to the 
Disabilit y Support Consultant, so a Disability Support Agreement can be developed. If 
needed, Program Areas should utilise the expertise of the Australia Awards Disability 
Support Consultant and are not to engage a separate consultant;  
v. understand that development of Disability Support Agreements may take considerable 
time and all required information must be provided to the Disability Support 
Consultant at least four months before Semester 1 commencement dates;  
vi. manage awardee with disability expectations around tim eframes, their 
commencement date and ensure they understand they may need to defer if a 
Disability Support Agreement has not been finalised in time for Semester 1 
commencement dates;   
vii. enable awardees to provide and/or acquire a medical report (less than t wo years old 
and in English, or a certified translation) that establishes the nature of the disability 
and fully discloses any pre -existing conditions. These documents must be uploaded to 
OASIS as soon as received;  
viii. ensure awardees with disability meet the placement requirements of their chosen 
institution and advise institutions they are seeking placement of an awardee with 
disability as soon as the disability is disclosed;  
ix. enable Student Contact Officers consult with the Disability Support Consultant to 
arrange necessary support;

 x. finalise the placement of an awardee with disability only after agreeing, between 
DFAT, the awardee and the institution, on the nature of the support and reasonable 
adjustments and accommodations required and who will provide them ; 
xi. Program Areas will be required to defer awardees with disability to a later scholarship 
commencement date if a Disability Support Agreement has not been finalised and 
uploaded to OASIS  
xii. assist awardees with disability, and carers, with visa application re quirements 
including, but not limited to, meeting the costs of obtaining medical reports if required 
and liaising with Home Affairs on visa matters;  
xiii. provide additional pre -mobilisation assistance, for example during placement help 
awardees with disability select a suitable institution;  
xiv. seek awardee’s with disability agreement (signature) to Disability Support 
Agreements and upload finalised agreement to OASIS, and, where needed, arrange for 
Carers agreements to be put in place;  
xv. review disability entitlement  variations, submitted by Canberra, and approve in line 
with the PGPA Act 2013 and delegated financial responsibilities;  
xvi. ensure all aspects of OASIS are updated with travel details, awardee and carer 
details, and any other relevant information required by institutions, or the Disability 
Support Consultant. To ensure collaborative work utilise OASIS Journal Notes to add 
relevant information;  
xvii. submit mobilisation request for all awardee’s with disability to DFAT Canberra for 
mobilisation approval; and  
xviii. manage the expenditure of Disability Support Agreement items that cannot be 
expensed through OASIS (carer CLE, etc.).  
9.4.7.  {S} The Disability Support Consultant will:  
i. work closely with awardees with disability, Program Areas, institutions, and Canberra  
to ensure all related support for awardees with disability is inclusive, adheres to 
Australia legislation and ensures equal participation in the scholarship;  
ii. develop Disability Support Agreements for all awardees with disability to be signed by 
DFAT, the awardee and any relevant  third parties;  
iii. hold discussions with the institution Student Contact Officer and disability unit as part 
of the Disability Support Process. Discussions should cover any additional assistance 
that an awardee with disability may require for living and studying in Australia and 
before they arrive on -campus;  
iv. confirm that the institution can  provide relevant reasonable academic adjustments for 
the awardee with disability prior to mobilisation;

 9.5. Reasonable adjustments  and accommodations  
9.5.1.  The Disability Discrimination Act 1992 requires education to be provided in a 
non-discriminatory way to all students studying in Australia (regardless of nationality). 
The Disability Standards for Education 2005 require reasonable adjustments to be made to enable this non- discriminatory participation.  
9.5.2.  For the purposes of this document,  DFAT makes a clear distinction between 
reasonable adjustments and reasonable accommodations.  
9.5.3.  Reasonable adjustments are measures which an education provider is required to make to ensure students with a disability can meet the academic standards of their course of study and participate on the same basis as students without a disability. Reasonable adjustments might include changes to the way a person enrols in a course, alterations to the physical environment and other facilities, and changes to the way training is delivered and skills are assessed.  
9.5.4.  Neither the Act nor the Standards require reasonable adjustments to be made if this would impose an unjustifiable hardship on a person or organisation (all factors are considere d, including impact on the student, or institution, etc.).  
9.5.5.  To ensure the participation of awardees with a disability , DFAT offers non -academic 
reasonable a ccommodations, w hich complement the legislated reasonable 
adjustments partner institutions are obligated to provide.   
9.5.6.  Reasonable accommodation is the provision of support, modifications and/or adjustments that meet the individual needs of people  with disabilities to ensure they 
enjoy and exercise all human rights and fundamental freedoms on an equal basi s to 
others. Reasonable accommodation can include the provision of accessible transportation ,  
sign-language interpreters, accessible meeting venues, and documents in accessible 
formats.  
9.5.7.  Reasonable accommodations are assessed on the same basis and at the same time as reasonable adjustments through the Disability Assessment P rocess.  
9.5.8.  {A} Awardees must be aware that, while institutions are obliged to make reasonable 
adjustments to allow students with disability to participate on a level playing field with 
other students, there is a limit to this obligation. For example, if an awardee requires 
course materials in an accessible format, institutions will provide alternative or 
accessible formats to enable participation. However, this does not necessarily mean 
that institutions must  provide materials in an awardee’s preferred format.  
Responsibilities for r easonable adjustments and accommodations  
9.5.9.  Institutions have an obligation to provide awardees with reasonable adjustments to support their academic endeavours.  
9.5.10.  DFAT  provides non -academic reasonable accommodations . Refer  below for 
clarification of the responsibilities of institutions and DFAT .  
Page 65 of 148 
Australia Awards Scholarships Policy Handbook April  2023  
(A) = applicant/awardee  (P) = Program Area  (I) = institution     (S) = Global Education and Scholarships Section  
 Reasonable adjustments  
9.5.11.  {I} Institutions are required to consult with awardees with disability about their 
support and access needs to determine what reasonable adjustments are appropriate 
and necessary.  
9.5.12.  {I} Reasonable adjustments for academic support should be funded by institutions 
through their standard disability support mechanisms. Typical examples of academic 
reasonable adjustments include:  
i. access to and training in the use of assistive technology  
ii. access to lecture summaries, overheads or PowerPoint pres entations  
iii. additional clarification of course materials by lectures and tutors  
iv. advice about where to sit lecture  theatres and classrooms  
v. inclusive teaching strategies  
vi. communication through the awardee’s preferred method of communication 
vii.  additional academi c assistance or extra time in the lead up to exams and other 
assessments where deemed necessary by the institutio n 
viii. alternative exam and assessment formats  
ix. accessible parking  
x. disability advocacy and support , and 
xi. provision of tutors and note takers for disability support (tutoring or similar support 
for purely academic purposes can be funded through supplementary academic 
support as for all awardees).  
Reasonable accommodations  
9.5.13.  {P} DFAT provides non -academic reasonable accommodations and inclusive support  
for awardees with disability as required. Non- academic reasonable accommodations 
will be based on the needs identified by DFAT through an awardee’s disability 
assessment and may include:  
i. accessible interviews  
ii. accessible pre -departure materials, procedures  and programs, and support to attend 
pre-departure events where required  
iii. assistance to select an institution and work with that institution to access academic 
reasonable adjustment s 
iv. assistance to find and access accessible housing  
v. alternative transport arrangements to and from Australia and in Australia  
vi. support for full -time, part -time or non -ongoing carers  
vii. funds for equipment that is essential to the successful completion of an awardee’s 
scholarship 
viii. additional funds for Overseas Student Health Cover; and  
ix. limited access to additional medical support and allied health care.

(A) = applicant/awardee  (P) = Program Area  (I) = institution     (S) = Global Education and Scholarships Section  
 9.5.14.  The Global Education and Scholarships Section assists Program Areas, managing 
contractors and institutions by engaging a Disability Support Consultant who 
collaborates with all areas, in cluding awardees, to developing Disability Support 
Agreements, which ensure ongoing disability support throughout the life of the 
scholarship.  
9.5.15.  Access to disability support funding ends five days after the completion of the 
scholarship, in line with CLE entitlement.  
9.6. Carers  
9.6.1.  DFAT provides financial support for the care of awardees with disability however, the 
provision of any care arrangements will be determined by the Disability Support Consultant, in consultation with the awardee and Program Area.  
9.6.2.  When assessing the need for a carer, the Disability Support Consultant will take into consideration existing care requirements and the technology and support services available in Australia, which may allow an awardee to develop new disability management s kills and live more independently.  
9.6.3.  {A} Awardees must assist in identifying a person to provide care. Where possible the 
best person to provide care in Australia is the person that provides care in their home 
country. The carer identified must be able to provide care in an Australia context.  
9.6.4.  {A} Carers must be aware of the support provided by DFAT and agree to their role as 
carer by signing a Disability Support Carers Agreement.  
9.6.5.  {A} Any funds provided by DFAT to support the carer are to be used for that function, 
in full knowledge of the carer.  
9.6.6.  A carer must  meet the following criteria:  
i.  be aged 18  or over prior to mobilisation  
ii. not be a  current  Australia Award s scholarship awardee  
iii. be able to spea k a basic level of English (Program Areas  may provide some Engl ish 
language training prior to mobilisation ) 
iv. be physically able to undertake the caring dutie s 
v. be available for the required scholarship duration ; and  
vi. meet the visa requirements  
9.6.7.  Where the spouse (de jure or de facto) of an awardee  with a disability is an awardee’s 
carer, they m ust apply for a Student visa (subclass 500) as a dependant.  Where  an 
awardee’s carer is not  their  spouse , the carer should apply for a Subclass 590 visa.   
9.6.8.  Student Guardian visa (subclass 590) applicants must provide evidence of thei r carer 
responsibilities in Australia  to the Department of Home Affairs . Either a Disability 
Support Agreement from DFAT outlining their caring role in Australia or a ‘DFAT Carer Requirement Statement’, provided by Program Area, is sufficient .  Refer  
Home Affairs  
website  f or more information. 
9.6.9.  DFAT will fully fund any visa costs associated with a Student Guardian visa (subclass 590).   
Page 67 of 148 
Australia Awards Scholarships Policy Handbook April  2023  
(A) = applicant/awardee  (P) = Program Area  (I) = institution     (S) = Global Education and Scholarships Section  
 9.6.10.  A Student Guardian visa (subc lass 590) does not generally provide working rights. In 
addition, DFAT holds the expectation a full -time carer will not seek additional work 
while in Australia.  
9.6.11.  {I} Institutions must organise OSHC cover for carers on dependant 500 visas. These 
carers can be added to the awardee’s OSHC cover and must have health insurance for 
the entire period they are in Australia.  
9.6.12.  {P} Program Areas must organise Overseas Visitor  Health Cover for carers who are on 
Student Guardian (subclass 590) visas. 590 visa holders must have health insurance for 
the entire period they are in Australia.

 Health Conditions  
9.10.5.  The Australia Awards Scholarships program draws a distin ction between people with 
disability and people who are experiencing health issues. This distinction takes into 
consideration the overall aims of the Australia Awards Scholarships program and the ability of an individual to successful complete a scholarshi p. 
9.10.6.  Where an applicant or awardee is unable to study due to a n illness,  they will not 
generally qualify for disability support. Each case is considered on an individual basis . 
9.10.7.  Awardees with pre -existing conditions are advised to research their needs and 
determine what support is available in Australia or from their home country to support 
them while they are on scholarship.  It will be the responsibility of the awardee to meet a ny health costs not covered by the Overseas Student Health Cover . 
9.10.8.  Experience demonstrates that awardees experience heightened stress from undertaking a scholarship in Australia (a foreign country) in a second language, with a different culture and a string ent academic regime. Awardees should be aware that 
underlying or dormant medical conditions are often revived by such stresses and should arrive prepared to deal with them.

optional medical treatment at  times that do not negatively impact on their 
participation in their course (i.e. over semester breaks ). Refer  clause 14.6.4 for further 
information.  
9.10.12.  Program Areas and the Disability Support Consultant must ensure  awardees with 
disability understand what i s out of scope and ensure awardee expectations are 
managed  appropriately .

Health Cover  provider. In this case, the institution will only pay for the 
equivalent of single cover, and the awardee will pay the balance, or  
ii. purchase family cover from a provider other than the institution’s preferred 
provider. In this case the institution is still required to purchase single Overseas 
Student Health Cover  for the awardee for the duration of their stay in Australia. 
The awardee will be responsible for the entire cost of the family cover.

institution’s preferred  provider for the period of their scholarship. This will be in 
addition to the awardee’s family cover.  
10.4.13.  {I} When an awardee is on suspension the institution will suspend the Overseas 
Student Health Cover for the suspension period and reactivate the policy upon the 
awardee’s return to studies.  When an awardee completes their scholarship early, 
the institutio n will return the remaining Overseas Student Health Cover premium to 
DFAT.  The awardee is not permitted to claim the refund.  If the awardee does so it 
will be considered as an act of fraud against the Commonwealth of Australia.  The 
fraud will be investigated and may result in a termination of the awardee’s 
scholarship and possible criminal charges.

11.3.3.  {A} After the awardee has accepted their scholarship offer, they are 
required to immediately contact the institution if they would like to be 
accommodated on -campus (even if only for the first semester). Institutions 
may have a ballot system for on -camp us accommodation and will require 
an early indication of interest.  
11.3.4.  {A} All awardees are to prepare a plan for their transport and 
accommodation when they arrive in Australia. The awardee is to share this 
plan with the student contact officer at their institution at least fourteen 
days before their planned arrival in Australia.  
Initial accommodation  
11.3.5.  {A} Awardees must notify institutions if they do not require initial 
accommodation to be arranged for them. They must do this by email at 
least three weeks befor e arriving in Australia. If they fail to advise the 
institution, the awardee will be responsible for all associated costs of that 
accommodation.  
11.3.6.  {A} Awardees with accompanying family members may ask the institution 
to include the family members in the init ial accommodation booking. 
Institutions are not required to make accommodation arrangements for 
family members.

 12. Academic support  
12.1. Introductory Academic Program  
12.1.1.  The Introductory Academic Program is mandatory for all awardees. It is  
intended to provide awardees with support during their first weeks in 
Australia; prepar e them  for study in Australia ; enhance their ability to 
meet the demands of their studies ; and maximise the likelihood of success 
in their course b y the scholarship completion date. The IAP may  enable an 
institution to monitor an awardee’s capability and identify those who may 
need further assistance during  their studies.  
12.1.2.  The Introductory Academic Program will be conducted over a four -to-six-
week  period.   The IAP is compulsory for all awardees. Failure to attend the 
Introductory Academic Program may result in the awardee  forfeiting their 
scholarship.  
12.1.3.  {A} Attendance at the Introductory Academic Program is compulsory for all 
awardees . Failure to attend the Introductory Academic Program may result 
in termination of the scholarship.  
12.1.4.  {A} Annex A contains detailed information about the IAP.  
12.2. Supplementary Academic Support (SAS) funds 
12.2.1.  A limited amount of supplementary academic support  funding  is available 
where the institution, awardee or Program Area  identifies that  assistance 
is required in line with the institution’s academic requirements. Funds may 
be used for:  
i. Tutoring  and other academic support  related to the awardees prin cipal 
course of study . 
ii. SAS entitlements can be used for domestic academic training or 
workshops directly related to the awardees main course of study and 
this includes to attending  conferences  is in Australia.  The conference 
must align to the discipline enrolled. SAS entitlements may not be used 
for attending conferences outside Australia .  
iii. editing theses, printing and binding costs . 
12.2.2.  SAS is accrued at A $500 every six months (i.e. A $1000 a year) for the period 
of the scholarship. The accrued funds may be expensed at any time during 
the scholarship. The  funds , however,  cannot be expensed in advance  (e.g. if 
an activity happens during the first semester of a  scholarship, the 
associated costs cannot exceed the actual accrued amount of A $500).  
12.2.3.  {A} Awardees wanting to access SAS funds must contact the Student 
Contact Officer at their institution and gain approval for the use of these 
funds. If the institution approves the use of the funds, the institution will 
advise the awardee whether the institution will pay the approved funds 
directly to the service provider, or if the awardee can be reimbursed upon 
the awardee’s presentation of original receipts.

Australia Awards Scholarships Policy Handbook April  2023  
{A} = applicant/awardee      {P} = Program Area    (I) = institution     (S) = Global Education and Scholarships Section  
 12.2.4.  {I} When determining the activity to be funded, the institution is ex pected 
to consider, but not limited to, whether:  
i. the assistance to be funded with the SAS can be provided at no cost 
through the institution’s academic support mechanisms or  
ii. the awardee has sufficient remaining accrued funds for the activity 
after all prev ious costs against this entitlement have been expensed in 
OASIS.  
12.2.5.  {I} Once the institution has approved expenditure of SAS funds for an 
awardee, the institution must either:  
i. pay the costs of the approved activity directly to the service provider, or  
ii. reimburse the awardee upon presentation of original receipt(s) for the 
agreed support service.  
12.2.6.  {I} SAS funding must not be used:  
i. to purchase IT hardware, specialised software or textbooks (awardees 
may use the establishment allowance for this purpose) or  
ii. to meet the expenses of adjustments made for awardees with 
disability (as this is the institution’s responsibility) or 
iii. towards any associated costs for fieldwork/field trips or study tour 
units (either selective or compulsory).  
12.2.7.  {I} The institution must monitor the provision of the entitlement and 
maintain records of expenditure for each awardee in OASIS. According to 
its contract with institutions, DFAT may audit these records at any time.  
12.3. Fieldwork  
12.3.1.  For the purpose of the Australia Awards Scholarships, fieldwork is defined 
as firsthand observations and data collection needing to be made in the 
field as opposed to those observed or collected in the controlled university 
environment.  
12.3.2.  The fieldwork entitlement is only a contribution to awardees’ fieldwork 
costs (as detailed in Section 12.3.5 ). The f ieldwork entitlement  only applies 
to awardees enrolled in a Master’s  by research,  a PhD or a Master’s  by 
coursework whi ch has a compulsory research  by fieldwork  component . The 
fieldwork entitlement should where possible  be included in the 
institution’s  initial offer.  
12.3.3.  Fieldwork should be undertaken in Australia or the awardee’s home 
country. In exceptional cases, Program Areas may agree to an awardee 
undertaking  fieldwork in another country.  If fieldwork in a country outside 
the awardee’s home country or region is  approved, DFAT will co ntribute a 
maximum of A $1500 to  cover  travel costs  only .  
12.3.4.  Fieldwork which is to take place in more than one location in Australia or in 
the applicant’s home country must be identified in the awardee’s 
approved research proposal.

{A} = applicant/awardee      {P} = Program Area    (I) = institution     (S) = Global Education and Scholarships Section  
 12.3.5.  For fieldwork undertaken outside Australia, o nly the  international  return 
airfares  to the airport closest to the fieldwork locati on will be funded 
during the scholarship period . For fieldwork undertaken in Australia, only 
the return travel from the awardee’s city or town of residence to the 
fieldwork location (where this is outside the city or town of residence ) will 
be funded. Funding will only be provided for  return  travel to th e first 
location where fieldwork is undertaken in multiple locations. Funding for 
all other costs associated with fieldwork should be sought from other 
sources available to awardees, including their academic faculty budget. 
DFAT will not cover costs which institutions typically cov er for other 
research awardees .  
12.3.6.  PhD awardees are entitled to three trips that can be either reunion  (if 
unaccompanied)  or fieldwork . Master’s  awardees are entitled to one trip 
that can be either reunion (if unaccompanied)  or fiel dwork. The number of 
fieldwork  trips  required is determined by the institution ( supervisor ) 
subject to the nature of the resea rch.  
12.3.7.  If fieldwork is conducted in the awardee’s home country, the awardee is 
not eligible for reunion  airfares  in the year fieldw ork is undertaken (i.e . a 
PhD awardee undertakes fieldwork in year 2 is not entitled to reunion 
airfare in that year but is eligible at the end of year s 1 and 3).  
12.3.8.  If fieldwork is conducted in a third country or in Australia, the standard 
reunion entitlement applies.  
12.3.9.  For awardees with disability, all fieldwork must include a management 
plan approved by the institution.  
12.3.10.  Fieldwork must be undertaken during the awardee’s period of studies such 
that the total period of the scholarship does not exceed the length of the 
course of studies as registered in CRICOS.    
12.3.11.  The maximum period which may be approved for fieldwork is 12 months.  
12.3.12.  Fieldwork must  not result in an extension to the scholarship.  
12.3.13.  {I} The institution must record the fieldwork details i n OASIS at the process 
placement stage. Failure to do so may result in funds for fieldwork not 
being approved.  
12.3.14.  {I} The institution (and awardees) should first investigate if some of the 
costs can be obtained from other sources (such as the institution’s 
research funds).  
12.3.15.  {I} The institution must seek approval from the Program Area (and it may 
also require approval from the partner government, where relevant) for 
fieldwork to be undertaken in a third country.  
12.3.16.  {I} The institution is responsible for organising fieldwork travel for the 
awardee. One return economy class airfare for a Master’s awardee and up 
to three for a PhD may be approved for the awardee to undertake 
fieldwork essential to their program.

{A} = applicant/awardee      {P} = Program Area    (I) = institution     (S) = Global Education and Scholarships Section  
 12.3.17.  {I} The institution must record the actual travel costs and details in OASIS 
once it has been booked  
12.3.18.  {I} If an awardee becomes ill or is unable to return from their fieldwork as 
planned, the Student Contact Officer should apply the Suspension Policy 
(refer 13.4).  
12.3.19.  {P} Program Areas will need to consider  the implications of approving 
fieldwork.  
12.3.20.  {A} Awardees must communicate with and provide all relevant information 
on the fieldwork to the Student Contact Officer to assist the institution in 
organising fieldwork travel. Failing to notify the Student Contact Office r 
may result in the cancellation of an awardee’s CLE entitlement.  
12.3.21.  {A} An awardee who is undertaking fieldwork out of Australia and who has 
dependents with them in Australia must consult the Department of Home 
Affairs on the policy relating to the dependent s staying in Australia or 
travelling with the awardee.  
12.3.22.  {A} If an awardee becomes ill or unable to complete their research as 
planned, they must immediately advise their Student Contact Officer and 
the Suspension policy will be applied (refer Section 13.4 ). 
12.4. Fieldtrips   
12.4.1.  {I} DFAT will only cover the cost of travel for fieldtrips where they are a 
requirement of the awardee’s study program.  The institution must record 
the cost as part of the academic fees in OASIS at the process placement 
stage (refer Chapter 5 ). Failure to do so may result in funds for the fieldtrip 
not being approved.  
12.4.2.  {I} If a fieldtrip to a country outside Australia or the awardee’s home region 
is approved by the Program Area, DFAT will contribute a maximum of 
A$1500 to cover travel costs only.  
12.5. Work attachments , placements or work experience 
12.5.1.  The maximum period of a work  attachment is 12 months.  
12.5.2.  Work attachments must be undertaken either in Australia or the awardee’s 
home country, noting that the awardee is responsible for all  costs . In 
exceptional cases, Program Areas may agree to work attachments taking 
place in another country within the region.  
12.5.3.  Work attachments must  be undertaken during the awardee’s period of 
studies such that the total period of the scholarship does not exceed the length of the course of studies as registered in CRICOS.  Work placements 
should not result in an extension to the scholarship.  
12.5.4.  Work experience to gain membership of an Australian association will not be supported, where the experience could be undertaken in the awardee’s home country to gain membership of the relevant association in that country.

{A} = applicant/awardee      {P} = Program Area    (I) = institution     (S) = Global Education and Scholarships Section  
 12.5.5.  {I} The institution must include the requirement for a work attachment in 
the institution’s original placement offer in OASIS (refer Chapter 5 . 
12.5.6.  {I} The institution will continue to pay the contribution to living expenses 
allowance during the work attachment, irrespective of any payment the 
awardee may receive from the hosting organisation.  
12.5.7.  {A} The awardee is responsible for:  
i. all costs associated with the work attachment 
ii. ensuring that any work undertaken complies with the Student visa 
(subclass 500) conditions and Australian taxation requirements.  
iii. information on visa conditions can be found at 
http://www.border.gov.au/Trav/Stud/More/Visa -conditions/visa -

12.6. Academic progress  
Satisfactory academic progress  
12.6.1.  Satisfactory academic progress means that the awardee has passed all 
subjects for the given period or has recorded satisfactory progress in a research program.  
12.6.2.  {I} Institutions must:  
i. maintain an up- to-date record of each awardee’s academi c progress in 
OASIS, as required under the institution’s contract with DFAT;  
ii. monitor and record academic progress of awardees at the end of each 
semester (or session); and  
iii. ensure that the awardee is on schedule to complete their course by 
the scholarship completion date  and is maintaining an appropriate 
study load.  
Unsatisfactory academic progress  
12.6.3.  If an awardee fails a subject or  fails to make satisfactory progress in a 
research program, in any two semesters (or sessions), the awardee  must 
show cause as to why they  should not have their scholarship terminated 
(refer  Section 13.9 ). 
12.6.4.  {A} An awardee’s scholarship may be terminated if they fail to make 
satisfactory progress. If an awardee fails to make satisfactory academic 
progress, they must sign and comply with the institution’s strategy and 
action plan to address the reasons for failure.  
12.6.5.  {A} If an awardee does not comply with the plan or continues to fail to 
make satisfactory academic progress the scho larship may be terminated.

Australia Awards Scholarships Policy Handbook April  2023  
{A} = applicant/awardee      {P} = Program Area    (I) = institution     (S) = Global Education and Scholarships Section  
 12.6.6.  {I} If an awardee fails a subject, or fails to make satisfactory progress in a 
research program, the institution must:  
i. record in OASIS at the end of each semester (or session) which subjects 
the awardee has failed or note that they have not made satisfactory 
progress in a research program  
ii. put in place a strategy and action plan in consultation with the awardee, 
to help them address the reasons for failure and remain on- schedule to 
complete their course by the completion date. The action plan could 
include for example:  
o supplementary academic support (e.g. additional tuition).  
o enrolling in non- standard sessions (e.g. summer school).  
o reducing the awardees workload in one semester and overloading 
in another (if the awardee is capable).  
o cross -institution enrolment to repeat/replace failed subjects.  
o course downgrade.  
iii. ensure that the action plan is signed/acknowledged by both the 
awardee and the institution, and that the action plan is uploaded into 
OASIS  
iv. request approval for the action plan, through OASIS, from the Program 
Area (including approval of any additional funds required for additional 
courses or supplementary academic support).  
12.6.7.  {P} Program Areas must monitor advice from Institutions in OASIS and, 
where an awardee has been identified as failing to make satisfactory 
progress, liaise with the institution to ensure funding is available for 
appropriate academic support to be provided.  
Study load  
12.6.8.  Awardees are not permitted to undertake a part -time study load for any 
reason oth er than extenuating circumstances. This is based on the student 
visa (Subclass 500) eligibility requirements. I n keeping with the standard 
under the National Code of Practice for Registration Authorities and 
Providers of Education and Training to Overseas Students, institutions may allow awardees to enrol in less than a full -time load in any standard study 
period (i.e. semester) if:  
i. there are compassionate or compelling reasons for reducing the load; 
ii. the reduced load is part of the institution’s strategy and action plan; 
iii. the awardee has studied, or plans to study, extra units in another study period and has provided a copy of their approved study plan to the Student Contact Officer ; 
iv. the awardee has only a few units left to complete,  and these do not 
constitu te a full -time load ; and  
v. prerequisite units are not available in that study period.

{A} = applicant/awardee      {P} = Program Area    (I) = institution     (S) = Global Education and Scholarships Section  
 12.6.9.  {A} Awardees may seek approval from their Student Contact Officer to 
spread their workload over more teaching periods (i.e. use non- standard 
sessions – summer, autumn, winter) where an institution offers non -
compulsory study periods, or to reduce their workload if they are having 
trouble adjusting.  
12.6.10.  {I} The institution must ensure the awardee follows an enrolment pattern 
that will allow them to complete within the expected duration in the 
normal course of events. For further information on the National code of 
Practice Standards, visit https://internationaleducation.gov.au/Regulatory -

 13. Variations to the terms of enrolment  
13.1. Scholarship conditions and terms of enrolment  
13.1.1.  Scholarships are awarded to recipients to obtain specified qualifications in 
order to contribute to development outcomes in their home country. The proposed course and the length of the scholarship are agreed by DFAT  and 
in some instances, the partner government, following advice from institutions. The terms of the Australia Awards Scholarship, and enrolment at the Australian institution, are then agreed to by the recipient by signing the letter of offer and contract with the Commonwealth of Australia.  
13.1.2.  Variations to the awardee’s terms of enrolment which e ffect the basis on 
which the scholarship was granted (e.g. change to field of study), will only be considered if they are  the only option s available to enable the awardee 
to successfully complete their program of study. All variations must be approved by the Director of the Program Area within  DFAT . 
13.1.3.  Variations will not be approved after the end date of a scholarship.  
13.1.4.  The types of variations that will be considered by DFAT  are detailed 
separately in this chapter.  
13.1.5.  {A} Awardees are advised that variations to the terms of their enrolment 
will be co nsidered in light of the scholarship’s aim of contributing to  the 
development of the awardee’s home country, and that the awardee’s 
tertiary education is intended to provide skills valuable to this aim. An 
awardee’s personal aspirations are of secondary im portance.  
13.1.6.  {P} All variations are managed and processed in OASIS by the Program Area 
and the institution . The only exception to this requirement is for 
terminations, which are approved by the Director of the Global Education 
and Scholarships Section.  
13.1.7.  {P} P rogram Areas will determine if partner government approval is 
required  for a variation, after which they may approve variations in accord 
with the relevant policy and in accord with appropriate financial 
delegations.  
13.1.8.  {P} Program Areas will endeavour to res pond to variation requests within 
2-4 weeks, depending on the complexity of the request, detail of 
information  provided, and the priorities of the Program Area.  
13.1.9.  {I} Institutions must seek timely approval from Program Areas as variations 
frequently involve commitment  of new funds. The only exception to this is 
for terminations, which are approved by the Director of the Global 
Education and Scholarships Section.  
13.1.10.  {I} Institutions must lodge variation requests as early as practical in OASIS. 
Which must be at least six weeks before the scholarship completion  date if 
the awardee is in the last semester of their scholarship. Variations 
submitted less than four weeks before payment batch processing due 
dates may not be approved prior to the due date of the payment batch.

Australia Awards Scholarships Policy Handbook April  2023  
{A} = applicant/awardee      {P} = Program Area    (I) = institution     (S) = Global Education and Scholarships Section  
 13.1.11.  {I} Institutions are to keep awardee’s OASIS records up- to-date, particularly 
when seeking variations (e.g. details of dependents, passport details etc.).  
13.1.12.  {I} When deciding if a variation is necessary, the institution should assess 
the options available to produce the most effective outcome. Befo re 
submitting a variation in OASIS relating to academic failure, institutions 
must ensure they have investigated and reported the following to DFAT 
(using the OASIS journal notes facility):  
i. scope of the academic difficulty including identification of the  specific 
academic issue (e.g. statistics, essay writing, exams, attendance, 
research or time management);  
ii. reasons for the failure, for example family stress, academic stress or 
health issues;  
iii. actions to be taken by both the awardee and institution to address the 
issue in the form of an action plan to address the shortcoming.  For 
example, if an awardee is suffering financial stress, the plan would 
identify counselling and financial management plans put in place, if 
research skills support is needed the plan would list extra academic 
support attended by the awardee and the outcomes of that support;  
iv. how realisti c is it that the awardee will successfully complete the 
current course; and  
v. Any option to downgrade the academic award, and if it is being 
considered.  
13.2. Withdrawals  
13.2.1.  An awardee may withdraw from their study program and forfeit their 
Australia Awards Scholarsh ip before or after their arrival in Australia.  
13.2.2.  {A} An awardee who wishes to withdraw from their scholarship must 
provide advice in writing to:  
i. the Program Area if the awardee has not departed for Australia; and  
ii. the institution if the awardee is in Australi a. 
13.2.3.  {A} Awardees who withdraw from their scholarship have 14 days to leave 
Australia . Awardees should contact the Student Contact Officer at their 
institution to arrange their return home travel. If the awardee does not 
return home, they will incur a debt to the Commonwealth for the 
scholarship costs ( Refer  Section 8.9 ). 
13.2.4.  {P} Program Areas are responsible for processing pre -departure 
withdrawals in OASIS.  
13.2.5.  {I} Institutions are responsible for notifying Program Areas and gaining 
their approval to process withdrawals for awardees in Australia who wish 
to withdraw from their scholarship.

Australia Awards Scholarships Policy Handbook April  2023  
{A} = applicant/awardee      {P} = Program Area    (I) = institution     (S) = Global Education and Scholarships Section  
 13.2.6.  {S} The Global Education and Scholarships Section must notify the 
Department of Home Affairs of the awardee’s withdrawal if the awardee is 
in Australia.  
13.2.7.  DFAT may withdraw a scholarship offer prior to the awardee's departure 
date if they are unable to commence their studies by the start of the intake 
year   
13.3. Extensions 
13.3.1.  An extension is any increase to the length of a scholarship and is requested 
by the institution in OASIS and approved by the Program Area.  
13.3.2.  Apart from an Honours year extension, only one extension to a maximum of six months may be approved for the duration of the scholarship. A 
request for extension will  not be considered for a study program that is 
only one academic year long.  
13.3.3.  Extensions will only be approved if there are legitimate reasons, including unforeseen and exceptional circumstances beyond the control of the awardee and the institution. Critical incidents and welfare issues are often  
best addressed with a suspension.  
13.3.4.  The option to extend an Australia Awards Scholarship will only be considered where:  
i. the awardee is already in the second or subsequent year of their course ; 
ii. the awardee is expected to achieve the qualification as a  consequence 
of the extension; 
iii. the institution deems an extension to be the only acceptable strategy to achieve the qualification; 
iv. the awardee has failed a subject and the institution has implemented a strategy to help them complete their study program on time and address the reasons for the failure; and  
v. the extension request has been lodged in accord with the instructions at  
Section  13.1.
9. 
13.3.5.  {A} If an extension to the scholarship is approved, the awardee will be 
responsible for paying any costs associated with gaining a new visa.  
13.3.6.  {A} It is the awardee’s responsibility to ensure that they contact the 
Department of Home Affairs in sufficient time to apply for a new visa to 
extend their stay in Australia.  
13.3.7.  {A} Awardees are not permitted to self -fund an in- Australia extension to 
their scholarship. They are permitted to self- fund an extension to complete 
in their home country, if the institut ion allows.  
13.3.8.  {P} Program Areas must maintain thorough records of extension requests, 
approvals and rejections in OASIS, including the rationale for the decision, 
which must be in line with the extension policy.

 13.3.9.  {I} The institution should consider all possible options to avoid the need for 
an extension in situations  where an awardee is not likely to finish their 
studies on time. These options include:  
i. suspension of their Australia Awards Scholarship;  
ii. supplementary  academic support;  
iii. enrolling in non- standard sessions (e.g. summer school) to repeat 
failed subjects;  
iv. cross -institution enrolment to repeat/replace failed subjects;  
v. course downgrade;  
vi. overloading in subsequent semesters only if the awardee is capable;  
vii. compl etion of studies from home, particularly for research courses. In 
such cases the awardee would not receive any further funding from 
DFAT; and  
viii. termination of the scholarship if the awardee has failed a subject or 
failed to make satisfactory progress in a re search program in any two 
semesters during the scholarship period.  
13.3.10.  {I} Where an extension is recommended, the institution must ensure that 
appropriate support, monitoring and counselling strategies are in place 
that will enable the awardee to complete with in the revised duration. 
13.3.11.  {I} The institution must submit a study plan signed by the awardee and the 
institution together with the extension variation for the Program Area’s 
consideration. Research awardees  must submit a letter of support from 
their supervisor along with a detailed submission timeline.  
13.3.12.  {I} If the awardee is unlikely to achieve the desired outcome with the 
assistance provided, the institution should recommend termination of the 
scholarship to the Global Education and Scholarships Section. The  
institution should fund all or part of the course -related expense of 
extending an award where the institution has failed to:  
i. adequately monitor the awardee’s progress;  
ii. take mitigating action where the reasons for requiring the extension 
occurred before the last two semesters of study; and  
iii. provide appropriate academic supervision and support to the awardee 
to enable them to complete the scholarship on time.  
13.3.13.  {I} Institutions must maintain thorough records on extension requests, 
approvals and rejections in OA SIS.

 13.4. Suspensions 
13.4.1.  A scholarship may be suspended if deemed necessary (e.g. for health 
reasons,  family  or due to misconduct  reasons ).  
13.4.2.  A scholarship may be suspended more than once, but the total period of all suspensions must not exceed 12 months.  
13.4.3.  Suspension variations are requested by the institution in OASIS and approved by the Program Area.  
13.4.4.  If an awardee has already been granted an extension of their scholarship, a suspension will not be granted if it will result in additional cost.  
13.4.5.  If a suspension is approved, no contribution to living expenses or other fees or entitlements will be paid for the period of suspension.  The OSHC must be suspended for this period as well  – should a student remain in 
Australia;  they will be responsible for paying for  their Overseas Student 
Health Cover . 
13.4.6.  Awardees may  use their reunion airfare entitlement in advance to fund 
their return home tr avel.  In the absence of a reunion entitlement DFAT  
will fund the awardee ’s return  trip airfare.  The aw ardee is responsible for  
their  dependent s’ airfares.  
13.4.7.  Where a suspension results in an awardee having to repeat subjects for which fees have already been incurred, the request will be handled as a suspension with an extension. No further requests for an extension will be permitted  for the remainder of the scholarship.  
13.4.8.  {A} If a suspension of the scholarship is approved, the awardee must:  
i. return to their home country (with their family if accompanied) for the 
period of the suspension;  
ii. remain in contact with the Program Area in -Coun try during the period 
of the suspension  
iii. seek prior approval of DFAT and the institution before returning to 
Australia at the end of the suspension period;  
iv. contact the institution at least two months before they intend 
returning to Australia, to agree upon their scholarship 
recommencement date;  
v. contact the Department of Home Affairs for information about visa 
requirements; and  
vi. if unable to return home, provide their own Overseas Student Health 
Cover for the period they are in Australia.  
13.4.9.  {A} If a suspension is granted on medical grounds, the awardee will be 
required to undergo a medical examination to determine if they are fit to 
travel and to resume full -time study in Australia. This examination will be 
at the awardee’s expense. A suspension  will not be granted for an awardee 
to undergo and/or recover from elective surgery ( Refer  Section 14.6.4 )

{A} = applicant/awardee      {P} = Program Area    (I) = institution     (S) = Global Education and Scholarships Section  
 13.4.10.  {A} Awardees may be required to provide documentary evidence of their 
fitness to study to DFAT and the institution before approval will be given 
for their return to Australia and before a return flight will be booked on 
their behalf.  
13.4.11.  {P} Program Areas are to assess suspension requests in line with this policy 
and seek approval from partner  governments where applicable.  
13.4.12.  {P} If  a suspension is granted  on medical grounds, the Program Areas may 
be required to assist the awardee in -Country during the period of 
suspension ( Refer  Sections 15.7 and 17.5 ). 
13.4.13.  {I} The institution should assess a suspension request giving consideration 
to the remaining duration of the scholarship and the likely effects of the 
suspension (especially the break from study) on satisfactory completion of 
the course.  
13.4.14.  {I} Requests for suspension are to be lodged by the institution as early as 
possible in OASIS and are to include the revised scholarship completion 
date and any additional costs, including the cost of return airfares for the 
suspension in the absence of the reunion entitle ment.  
13.4.15.  {I} The institution should organise suspension travel to the airport closest 
to the awardee’s home and invoice DFAT for the cost.  Suspension travel 
should be organised as soon as possible after the suspension has been 
approved by DFAT.  
13.4.16.  {I} The institution must suspend the awardee’s Overseas Student Health 
Cover for the suspension period.  
13.4.17.  {I} If the awardee:  
i. has their scholarship suspended due to illness or accident, they will 
need an assessment of their health and capacity to manage their 
studies before they return from suspension. Where the awardee has 
not returned home because they were unfit to travel, the institution 
must help organise this assessment; and 
ii. is deemed fit to return to their studies, the institution must assist the 
awardee to obtain  a new Student visa (subclass 500  
13.5. Transfers  
13.5.1.  A transfer between courses or to another institution is subject to Program 
Area approval, and where relevant, partner government approval. Transfers will only be considered where there is no alternative option available, and the transfer is in line with the priority areas as identified in 
the relevant country or region profile.  
13.5.2.  The course or institution transfer must not result in an extension of time to the scholarship.  
13.5.3.  Only one transfer request  may be approved per awardee.   
Page 101 of 148 
Australia Awards Scholarships Policy Handbook April  2023  
{A} = applicant/awardee      {P} = Program Area    (I) = institution     (S) = Global Education and Scholarships Section  
 Change to field of study  
13.5.4.  A change to the field of study is not permitted (e.g. a request for a transfer 
from an arts to a science degree). However, an institution may recommend that an awardee change to a different course within the same field of study at an institution that would be more appropriate to the awardee’s and country priority needs.  
Course transfer  
13.5.5.  A course transfer is entered in OASIS by the institution where the awardee is enrolled and approved by the Program Area.  
13.5.6.  {I} A course tra nsfer is used to transfer an awardee from one course to 
another at the same institution (at the same or lower level). If the name or 
CRICOS code of an enrolled course changes, an institution will need to 
enter a course transfer in OASIS.  Institutions are required to provide a 
strong justification before seeking approval from the Program Area for a 
transfer.  
Institution transfer  
13.5.7.  An institution transfer  is used if the awardee is transferring (at the same or 
lower level) to a different institution.  
13.5.8.  Acceptable reasons for a transfer  are: 
i. movement of an academic supervisor (research awardees) ;  
ii. the institution ceases to offer the course  
iii. course downgrades ; and  
iv. the awardee fails to meet the entry requirements of their university after they have completed  pre-course English or other preliminary 
courses, but they meet the entry requirements of a sim ilar course at 
another university . 
13.5.9.  For awardees with disability, the Student Contact Officer must contact the Disability Support Consultant before commencing any preparations for transfer.   
13.5.10.  {A} If an institution transfer is approved, the awardee must meet  any costs 
associated with the transfer (e.g. costs of relocating).  
13.5.11.  {P} Program Areas may approve a transfer only if:  
i. the transfer institution is an institution contracted with DFAT;  
ii. the new course is considered by the Program Area to be consistent 
with th e country program priorities and partner government 
requirements (where applicable);  
iii. it will not result in an extension of time to the scholarship; and  
iv. the awardee is likely to successfully complete the scholarship.  
13.5.12.  {I} If the course to which an awardee transfers is shorter than the original 
course, the receiving institution must reduce the duration of the 
scholarship in OASIS and advise the awardee of their scholarship in line 
with their reduced study period.

 13.6. Upgrades 
13.6.1.  Awardees  are generally not permitted to upgrade to a higher -level  course 
(either within the same institution or at another institution) during or after 
completion of their scholarship. However, the following upgrades are permitted, subject to Program Area and part ner government approval 
where relevant  (please note that not all Pro gram Areas allow for an 
upgrade ): 
i. where an institution has recommended an awardee undertake an Honours program ; and  
ii. awardees undertaking a Master’s  program  may be permitted, in very 
except ional circumstances, to upgrade to a PhD program if they meet 
the strict requirements as outlined in Section s 13.6.2 – 13.6.9
. 
Upgrade to a PhD  
13.6.2.  DFAT  would prefer the placement into a PhD program be confirmed during 
the scholarship application phase. However, as this is not always possible, the following outlines the criteria and procedures Program Areas will apply when considering a request for a scholarship to be upgraded to a PhD.  
13.6.3.  This policy recognises that  building research capacity in a developing 
country will contribute to its economic development and poverty reduction. Allowing upgrades from a Master’s  to a PhD program should 
mean that the awardee’s contribution to their home country’s research capacity will be enhanced.  
13.6.4.  The awardee will sign a deed of amendment to their ‘acceptance of o ffer’ 
contract, confirming final approval by DFAT Program Area. DFAT will send 
the deed of amendment to the awardee via the institution to be signed 
and returned for the delegate to sign. Program Areas  will file one original 
and return two to the institution (one for its file and one for the awardee).  
13.6.5.  {A} The awardee must submit their request for the upgrade to their 
institution including all supporting documentation, a mi nimum of 30 days 
before the awardee’s scholarship completion date (DFAT will not support 
awardees remaining in Australia pending any decision on approvals for an 
upgrade).  
13.6.6.  {A} The awardee must submit the following with their request for an 
upgrade:  
i. clear w ritten justification for the upgrade, including evidence that they 
are likely to return to a position in their home country or region which 
will enable them to pass on their research skills (e.g. evidence of 
previous relevant employment in an academic or r esearch 
environment; a letter of potential employment in such an institution 
on return home);  
ii. evidence that they will be able to enhance research links between 
their home country and Australia; and   
Page 103 of 148 
Australia Awards Scholarships Policy Handbook April  2023  
{A} = applicant/awardee      {P} = Program Area    (I) = institution     (S) = Global Education and Scholarships Section  
 iii. a brief proposal, including a project timeline, demonstrat ing how the 
PhD will be completed within the total of four years, including how the 
Master’s studies to date have contributed to achieving that deadline.  
13.6.7.  {A} Once the Program Area has given in -principle  approval for an upgrade, 
the awardee must subsequently provide evidence that they have been 
accepted into the proposed PhD program before final approval by the 
Program Area can be given.  
13.6.8.  {A} If approval for the upgrade is given, the awardee must apply for  and 
self-fund a further visa to stay in Australia beyond the end date of their 
initial visa ( Refer  Section 8.6 ).  
13.6.9.  {P} Program Areas and the partner government where applicable, may 
consider upgrades of exceptional awardees from a Master’s to a PhD on a 
case -by-case basis under the following criteria:  
i. the PhD will be undertaken at the same institution at which the 
awar dee is studying a Master’s program under the scholarship; and  
ii. the upgrade will result in the study period (and hence the scholarship 
duration) not exceeding four years in total (i.e. the equivalent duration 
had the institution’s initial offer been for the PhD).  
13.6.10.  {P} Program Areas must advise the Global Education and Scholarships 
Section  if an upgrade is approved, and upload the deed of amendment, 
signed by the awardee, in OASIS.  
13.6.11.  {I} The institution must:  
i. submit the request for an upgrade, including all suppo rting 
documentation listed at Section 13.6.6 , to Program Areas  at least 
30 days before the awardee’s scholarship completion date;  
ii. ensure the supervisor and the institution’s chair of the Research 
Committee or equivalent support the upgrade; and 
iii. upload into  OASIS copies of all half -yearly reports submitted by the 
supervisor to the research committee or equivalent.  
13.6.12.  {S} In the event that an upgrade is approved, the Global Education and 
Scholarships Section will provide a “No  Objection Letter” for the awardee 
to apply to the Department of Home Affairs for a further visa to remain in 
Australia beyond the initial visa end date.  
Reductions 
13.6.13.  A variation  to reduce the length of a scholarship may be required for a 
number of reasons:  
i. an awardee completing their study ahead of time . (A finalisation 
variation may also be used for this purpose ). 
ii. conditions of the scholarship not being met . 
iii. in the case of articulated courses, the first course  is completed but not 
at a sufficient  level to undertake the second course.   
Page 104 of 148 
Australia Awards Scholarships Policy Handbook April  2023  
{A} = applicant/awardee      {P} = Program Area    (I) = institution     (S) = Global Education and Scholarships Section  
 13.6.14.  {I} The institution must advise the Global Education and Scholarships 
Section  of a revised scholarship end date via OASIS and advise the awarde e 
that DFAT will remove support for their visa 30 days after their revised 
scholarship end date.  
13.6.15.  {S} The Global Education and Scholarships Section will advise the 
Department of Home Affairs that it is withdrawing support for the 
awardee’s visa 30 days afte r the end date of the awardee’s Australia 
Awards Scholarship.  
13.7. Entitlement variations  
13.7.1.  An entitlement  variation is used to:  
i. add courses (pre -course English or articulating courses) . 
ii. add entitlements (fieldwork, reunion airfare etc. ). 
iii. remove entitlements (reu nion airfare etc. ). 
iv. edit dates for courses or the scholarship, which in turn impacts on the 
value of entitlements  
v. increase or decrease the value of entitlements.  
13.7.2.  Variations must be raised before the scholarship end date or they will not be approved.  
13.7.3.  {P} If an entitlement variation is required before the awardee departs for 
Australia, the Program Area is responsible for entering the entitlement 
variation.  
13.7.4.  {P} A deferral variation must be raised before the awardee arrives in 
Australia.  
13.7.5.  {P} All variations in  OASIS will be processed as soon as possible.  
13.7.6.  {I} Institutions entering entitlement variations should provide details about 
why the variation is required to assist the Program Area in its decision-
making.  
13.7.7.  {I} Institutions must raise variations in OASIS as soon as possible to allow 
Posts sufficient time to process and seek approval.  
13.7.8.  {I} Entitlement variations for PhD, Master’s by research or Master’s by 
coursework with a mandatory fieldwork component should include an 
updated study plan with timeframes demonstrating that academic 
completion is likely in the revised time period requested in the variation.  
13.8. Terminations  
13.8.1.  DFAT  may at its  sole and absolute discretion terminate a scholarship where 
an awardee:  
i. does not make successful academic progress and remedial strategies have not been successful ; 
ii. has infringed or failed to meet the conditions of the scholarship;  
Page 105 of 148 
Australia Awards Scholarships Policy Handbook April  2023  
{A} = applicant/awardee      {P} = Program Area    (I) = institution     (S) = Global Education and Scholarships Section  
 iii. is excluded by the institution from the course or study units due to 
academic failure or from re maining at the institution because of 
misconduct (as defined by the institution) ;  
iv. has completed the maximum period of English language training available under the scholarship and still has insufficient English language ability for entry to the academic program ; 
v. is unable to continue a program due to serious illness or incapacity for medical/mental health reasons, and the awardee does not voluntarily withdraw ; 
vi. conducts themselves in a manner which is considered to have transgressed acceptable Australian community standards ; 
vii. applies for a different visa  other than the Student visa
 (subclass 500)  
viii. has travelled overseas or undertaking studies overseas without notifying DFAT and/or their institution;  
ix. is found to have committed an act of fraud; and  
x. is found gui lty of a n Australian criminal offence . 
 
13.8.2.  DFAT  reserves the right to terminate a scholarship  or withdraw an offer  
without a supporting recommendation from the institution where, in DFAT ’s view, the  continued funding of the awardee would be an 
inappropriate use of Australian Government funds.  
13.8.3.  In some cases,  an awardee may be offered the opportunity to downgrade , 
or withdraw from their scholarship, if the reason for termination is not a 
serious breach  of scholarship conditions, before a termination is pursued.  
13.8.4.  Terminations are instigated by the  Institutions and managed by Global 
Education and Scholarships Section at DFAT in Canberra in consultation 
with Post.  
13.8.5.  {A} The awardee will receive a letter of in tent to terminate from  Global 
Education and Scholarships  Section  at DFAT  in Canberra  advising:   
i. of the recommendation for their scholarship is to be terminated;  
ii. that the awardee has 14 days from the date of the letter to provide a 
statement detailing the r easons why the scholarship should not be 
terminated (the letter of appeal should be sent directly to: The 
Director, Global Education and Scholarships Section, by email to  
australiaawardsdelivery@df at.gov.au ;  
iii. that if DFAT proceeds with the termination, the awardee will no longer 
be eligible to hold a Student visa (subclass 500);  
13.8.6.  {A} If an awardee does not appeal the termination, their Australia Awards 
Scholarship will be terminated upon approval by the Director of Global 
Education and Scholarships Section.

{A} = applicant/awardee      {P} = Program Area    (I) = institution     (S) = Global Education and Scholarships Section  
 13.8.7.  {A} If the awardee appeals, DFAT may:  
i. reject the appeal, in which case D FAT’s decision is final; and  
ii. accept the appeal, in which case the awardee may continue with their 
course of study but must liaise with the Student Contact Officer at 
their institution in relation to meeting any conditions advised by DFAT.  
13.8.8.  {A} Where DFAT de cides to terminate the awardee’s scholarship, the 
awardee:  
i. will receive a formal letter of termination to advise that the 
scholarship has been terminated; and  
ii. must leave Australia and return to their home country within 1 4 days 
of their scholarship termina tion.  
13.8.9.  {A} Awardees should be aware that if their scholarship is terminated, this is 
a breach of their visa conditions and DFAT will refer the awardees details 
to the Department of Home Affairs for visa cancellation. If their visa is 
cancelled, they may be  excluded from returning to Australia for two years. 
The Department of Home Affairs considers an individual’s immigration 
history when making decisions on visa applications. If awardees do not 
depart Australia within 14 days after their scholarship is term inated,  they 
will incur a debt to the Commonwealth for the total accrued cost of their 
scholarship.  
13.8.10.  {I} The institution must:  
i. immediately advise the Global Education and Scholarships Section via 
OASIS if it becomes aware of any circumstances that may be grounds for 
termination, including those detailed in Section 13.9.1 ; and  
ii. If the termination is for reasons of academic failure, request 
terminations at least one  (1) month prior to census date if possible, to 
allow adequate time for the termination to occur, prior to course fees 
being charged.  
13.8.11.  {I} If DFAT decides not to terminate the awardee’s scholarship, the 
institution must:  
i. liaise with DFAT about any  conditions to be imposed on the 
continuation of the awardee’s scholarship; and  
ii. liaise with the awardee about complying with any conditions on 
continuation of their scholarship.  
13.8.12.  {I} If DFAT terminates the scholarship, the institution must assist the 
awarde e to make arrangements to return home within 14 days and 
arrange for the awardee’s Contribution to Living Expenses to cease  five 
(5)days after the termination date stated in the final termination letter 
(refer Sectio n 13.9. 8).

{A} = applicant/awardee      {P} = Program Area    (I) = institution     (S) = Global Education and Scholarships Section  
 13.8.13.  {S} Where DFAT decides there are grounds for termination, as outlined in 
Section 13.9.1 , it will provide the awardee with a letter of intent to 
terminate the scholarship.  
13.8.14.  {S} If an appeal is received from the awardee, the Director of Global 
Education and Scholarships Section will consider the appeal and either:  
i. accept the appeal, in which case the Global Education and Scholarships 
Section  must:  
o consult with the institution about whether conditions are to be 
imposed on continuation of the scholarship to ensure satisfactory 
completion of the awardee’s study program;  
o advise the awardee of the outcome in writing, including any 
conditions imposed on the continuation of their scholarship; and  
o provide copies of correspondence to the awardee about his/her 
appeal to the Student Contact Officer at the relevant institution and 
Program Area  
ii. reject the appeal, in which case the Global Education and Scholarships 
Section  must:  
o send a letter of termination to the awardee;  
o provide a copy the letter to the institution, Program Area and the 
Department of Home Affairs; and  
o advise the Department of Home Affairs that the awardee’s scholarship 
has been terminated and that DFAT no longer  supports the awardee 
holding a Student visa (subclass 500).  
13.8.15.  {S} If no appeal is received from the awardee within 14 days, the Global 
Education and Scholarships Section will terminate the scholarship following 
approval from the Director of Global Education and Scholarships Section.

 14. Welfare Incidents  
14.1. What is a Welfare Incident? 
14.1.1.  A welfare incident is any event or situation (not listed in Section 15 .1.3) 
that adversely affects, or has the potential to adversely effect, a n 
awardee’s ability  to successfully complete their scholarship.  
14.1.2.  A range of situations may qualify as welfare incidents including:  
i. any incident where a complaint is lodged or an awardee is otherwise 
accused, of harassment, sexual harassment or bullying ; 
ii. any incident where an awardee lodges a complaint or otherwise 
alleges they have been the victim of harassment, sexual harassment or 
bullying ; 
iii. any time that an awardee is diagnosed with a serious or chronic illness 
(including mental illness), or admitted to hospital in a non- emergency 
situation ;  
iv. any time that an awardee notifies that they are pregnant ; 
v. any time an awardee is referred for counselling ; 
vi. any time an awardee is the victim of crime overseas ; 
vii. any time that an awardee is un- contactable and has been absent from 
all classes for one full week without explanation; 
viii. any time an awardee’s accompanying family member in Australia is 
involved in (what would otherwise be) a critical incident  
ix. any time that an awardee notifies that a member of their  immediate  
family has died overseas ; 
x. a natural disaster that occurs outside Australia and may affect an 
awardee (i.e. in the home -country of awardees).  Approaches for 
responding in these situations are outlined Chapter 1 6; and  
xi. any allegations where an awardee is involved in a sexual misconduct or child protection incident.  
14.1.3.  If a member of the awardee’s family is involved in a critical or welfare 
incident, the awardee is responsible for all associated costs and 
arrange ments regarding the family member(s) involved in the incident.  
14.2. DFAT  Notification and Procedure for Welfare Incidents  
14.2.1.  Without exception, institutions must notify the Global Education and Scholarships Section b y email ( enquiries.canberra@australiaawards.org
 ) 
copied to Program Areas, as soon as possible within business hours when they become aware of any welfare incident  that has the potential to affect 
the awardees’ ability to successfully complete their scholarship. 
Institutions are required to provide only sufficient information to enable the Global Education and Scholarships Section to be satisfied that 
appropriate action and supports have been put in place to ensure the welfare of the awarde e.  
14.2.2.  Notification must follow the process outlined in this section.   
Page 109 of 148 
Australia Awards Scholarships Policy Handbook April  2023  
{A} = applicant/awardee      {P} = Program Area    (I) = institution     (S) = Global Education and Scholarships Section  
 14.2.3.  {I} The institution must first update the OASIS journal with a record of the 
welfare incident.  
14.2.4.  {I} Journal notes must be clear, factual  and compliant with all relevant 
State, Territory or Commonwealth legislation and regulations. Institutions 
should consider the privacy of the awardee and their family and ensure 
that personal information, and in particular sensitive information as 
defined in section 6 of the Privacy Act 1988, is only included in journal 
notes to the extent it is reasonably necessary to adequately describe the 
welfare incident and action taken.  
14.2.5.  {I} Once the OASIS journal is updated, the institution should also send an e -
mail to the australiaawardsdelivery@dfat.gov.au   bringing the incident to 
the attention of the Global Education and Scholarships Section. 
14.2.6.  {I} For any incident involving awardees with disability, the institution must 
copy the Disability Support Consultant  
(disability.support@australiaawards.org ) into all emails.  
14.2.7.  {I} E-mail notifications must have the following subject line: WELFARE 
INCIDE NT – awardee’s surname – awardee’s OASIS number.  (e.g.: 
WELFARE INCIDENT – JONES – ST0001234).  
14.2.8.  {I} Institutions are expected to notify the Global Education and 
Scholarships Section but should include in their e -mail notifications 
Program Areas managing co ntractors or c ase managers (if applicable).  
14.2.9.  {I} Where an institution’s first notification of a welfare incident comes from 
a Case Manager, the institution must inform DFAT that they were advised 
of the incident by the Case Manager.   
14.3. Principles for managing welfare incidents  
14.3.1.  DFAT ’s management of welfare incidents is based on an early -warning 
approach that allows us to ensure appropriate support for awardees facing 
health, welfare or academic issues.  
14.3.2.  This approach puts supporting awardees first, but  also acknowledges that 
DFAT  ultimately bears the financial and reputational risk associated with an 
awardee failing to complete their Australia Awards Scholarship. The key to this approach is prompt notification of the key aspects of a welfare incident.   
14.3.3.  Awardees will not be penalised for reporting and must understand that the capacity of DFAT  and institutions to support them in difficult times is 
limited by their own prompt disclosure of welfare incidents.  
14.3.4.  When deciding whether to report an incident and what information to 
provide, institutions, managing contractors and case managers  should 
consider whether a reasonable person would anticipate that the  incident 
has the potential to affect an awardee’s capacity to successfully complete their Australia Awards Scholarship. If the answer is yes, then the incident should be reported.

 Privacy 
14.3.5.  DFAT  respects awardee’s privacy.  However, in order to ensure they are 
properly supported in times of crisis, DFAT  also requires the disclosure of 
welfare incidents.  
14.3.6.  Awar dees agree, when they sign their Australia Awards Scholarship 
contract, that institutions, managing contractors and can share personal 
information about them and their dependants with DFAT , including 
sensitive information as defined in the Privacy Act 1988. This enables institutions, managing contractors and case managers to notify DFAT  of 
welfare incidents  to the extent that the welfare incident has the potential 
to affect the awardee’s ability to successfully complete their scholarship . 
14.3.7.  DFAT  does not require full disclosure of all personal and sensitive details of 
a welfare incident. DFAT  needs only enough information that is reasonably 
necessary to understand and assess any  risk to the awardee and to be 
confident that they are being appropriately supported.  The purpose of the 
disclosure of information is to enable DFAT  and others to properly manage 
welfare incidents affecting awardees and their scholarship conditions.   
DFAT will not use or  disclose the information for any other purpose.  
14.4. Welfare Incident – General Responsibilities  
14.4.1.  DFAT ’s primary concern is the welfare of awardees.  DFAT  expects all 
parties to respond to welfare incidents effectively, professionally, and in strict adherence to the policies and procedures outlined in this chapter.  
14.4.2.  Once reported, welfare incidents are managed on a case -by-case basis.  
However, there are some general procedures, outlined in this section, which must be followed for all welfare incidents.  
14.4.3.  {A} DFAT  respects the privacy of all awardees.  However, in order to ensure 
that DFAT and institutions can provide relevant support and assistance, 
DFAT recommends awardees bring all welfare incidents to the attention of 
their Student Contact Officer if the welfare incident has the potential to 
affect the awardee’s ability to successfully complete their scholarship.   
14.4.4.  {A} DFAT also recommends that awardees bring all critical and welfare 
incidents involving their family’s  members to the attention of their Student 
Contact Officer, if the welfare incident has the potential to affect the 
awardee’s ability to successfully complete their scholarship.  
14.4.5.  {A} Awardees should be aware that they will not be penalised for reporting 
welfare incidents. Any information that may then be passed onto DFAT will 
only need to be information that is reasonably necessary for DFAT to 
understand and assess any risk to the awardee and to be confident that 
they are being appropriately supported. DFAT will not use or disclose the 
information for  any other purpose.  
14.4.6.  {I} Institutions are responsible for notifying DFAT of welfare incidents. In 
particular:   
Page 111 of 148 
Australia Awards Scholarships Policy Handbook April  2023  
{A} = applicant/awardee      {P} = Program Area    (I) = institution     (S) = Global Education and Scholarships Section  
 i. Student Contact Officers must ensure that the Global Education and 
Scholarships Section i s notified of all welfare incidents as per 
processes and timelines outlined in Section 14.2 .   
ii. DFAT considers the Student Contact Officer to be the primary contact 
for all welfare incidents.  
iii. DFAT expects institutions to have appropriate protocols in place to 
ensure that Student Contact Officers are notified immediately should 
another area of the institutions become aware of an issue before the 
Student Contact Officer.  In such cases, institutions must ensure that 
personal privacy concerns do not prevent Student Contact Officers , 
and through them DFAT, being made aware of the general details of 
welfare incidents.  
iv. It is the responsibility of each institution to ensure that an officer will 
be avai lable to respond to any welfare incidents which occur when the 
Student Contact Officers are away from the office.  
14.4.7.  {I} Management and Response:  
i. Work with the awardee to establish a response or strategy to help 
them address the welfare incident and/or minimise the ongoing effect 
of the incident on their studies.  
ii. Continue to monitor the welfare incident, keep up- to-date records 
including OASIS journal notes, and report regularly to DFAT.  
iii. If necessary, intervene early with the awardee to discuss options, to 
man age their study load during a difficult time such as altered study 
plans, tutoring or short -term suspensions.  
iv. In addition to these general procedures, Refer  Sections 14.4 through 
14.11 w hich outline the responsibilities of all parties in response to 
different types of welfare incidents.  
14.4.8.  {I} If a welfare incident becomes or leads to a critical incident, in stitutions 
must escalate the incident immediately by following the notification and 
procedural requirements in Chapter 1 5. If an incident is escalated, DFAT 
may request the institution to provide additional information about t he 
original welfare issues and how the institution responded.  
14.4.9.  {P} Where a Program Area is made aware of a welfare incident, by any 
party other than the Student Contact Officer or the Global Education and 
Scholarships Section they must inform the Student Contact Officer and the 
Global Education and Scholarships Section as soon as possible within 
business hours.   
14.4.10.  {P} Once notified of a welfare incident the Program Area may be requested 
to work with the institution to develop a strategy to ensure the incident  is 
managed appropriately.   
Page 112 of 148 
Australia Awards Scholarships Policy Handbook April  2023  
{A} = applicant/awardee      {P} = Program Area    (I) = institution     (S) = Global Education and Scholarships Section  
    
14.4.11.  {P} Managing contractors and c ase managers (either in Australia or 
overseas) must  ensure that the scholarship programs they administer are 
managed effectively and efficiently.  This includes responding 
appropriately to welfare  incidents in accordance with the process outlined 
in this chapter.  
14.4.12.  {P} Where a managing contractor or Case Manager is made aware of a 
welfare incident, DFAT has an expectation that:  
i. Managing contractor or Case Manager must inform the relevant 
Student Contact Officer and the Global Education and Scholarships 
Section  as soon as possible in business hours.   
ii. case managers may also notify their immediate supervisor in Australia, 
in addition to notifying the relevant Student Contact Officer . 
iii. after the relevant Student Contact Officer is notified,  the Managing 
Contractor or Case Manager should work with the Student Contact 
Officer to develop a strategy to help the awardee manage and respond 
to the welfare incident.  
14.5. Conflict, Harassment and Bullying  
14.5.1.  During their time in Australia awardees may experience interpersonal 
conflict with friends, family, colleagues or staff at their institution.  DFAT  
considers all serious incidents of conflict to be welfare incidents.   
14.5.2.  Similarly, all incidents of harassment and bullying, that involve an awardee in any capacity, are also considered welfare incidents.  This includes the lodging of complaints of harassment or bullying by or against any awardee.  
14.5.3.  In the scholarship’s  context, harassment and bullying may  be described as 
repeated and unreasonable behaviour directed towards an awardee, or a group of awardees, that creates a risk to physical or mental health, safety and well -being.  It includes behaviour (generally a pattern of behaviour) 
that intimidates, o ffends, degrades or humiliates another awardee. 
Harassment and bullying could be sexual in nature, could be based on gender, race, religion or disability or could be unconnected to any particular characteristic of an individual.  
14.5.4.  Further information about bullying and harassment, including information on strategies to deal with bullying and harassment, is available on the Australian Human Rights Commission’s website at: http://www.hreoc.gov.au/bullying/index.html
. 
14.5.5.  Management of bullying and harassment that involves awardees (in any capacity) will be based on the severity of the incident.    
14.5.6.  In the event that an awardee is involved (in any capacity) in a serious interpersonal conflict, harassment, bullying or complaints, DFAT  has the 
following expectations.   
Page 113 of 148 
Australia Awards Scholarships Policy Handbook April  2023  
{A} = applicant/awardee      {P} = Program Area    (I) = institution     (S) = Global Education and Scholarships Section  
 14.5.7.  {A} Awardees are expected to act respectfully, treat others with dignity and 
avoid behaviours that could be considered threatening or harassing.  DFAT 
has an expectation that, as responsible adul ts, awardees have the capacity 
to mediate any minor interpersonal conflict they might experience, e.g. 
minor disputes within shared accommodation.  
14.5.8.  {A} However, awardees are not expected to remain silent if they are being 
made to feel uncomfortable or unsafe, and should report to their Student 
Contact Officer  as soon as possible if:  
i. they are being made to feel threatened or unsafe or  
ii. they are experiencing prolonged or repeated harassment or bullying, or  
iii. they feel they are being treated unfairly and their own efforts to resolve 
the matter have been unsuccessful.  
14.5.9.  {I} Institutions must:  
i. ensure the safety and wellbeing of all awardees and, when possible, any 
accompanying family members;  
ii. facilitate the provision of support to the awardee and, when possible, 
any accompanying family members. Support may include access to 
counselling services; and  
iii. manage the incident as per the institution’s standard conflict resolution 
and bullying and harassment policies.  
14.5.10.  The Guidelines to Counter Foreign Interference in the Australian University 
Sector support institutions to develop clear risk assessment and reporting frameworks that are available to all staff and students to guide decision-
making for activities at risk o f foreign interference. Foreign interference 
occurs when activities are carried out by, or on behalf of a foreign actor. 
Activities may be coercive, clandestine, deceptive or corrupting and are contrary to Australia’s sovereignty, values and national inter ests. 
Institutions should have transparent escalation and reporting mechanisms for foreign interference -related matters. Further information is available at 
https://www.education.gov.au/guidelines-counter-foreign- interference-
australian -university- sector .  
14.5.11.  {I} Institutions must report instances immediately to DFAT of perceived or 
actual foreign interference that concerns Australia Awards scho lars. 
Notification should be by an e -mail that clarifies all the relevant 
information sent to australiaawardsdelivery@dfat.gov.au . 
14.6. Health Issues and Hospitalisations  
14.6.1.  Awardees may experience phys ical or mental health problems whilst they 
are on scholarship .  Physical and mental health issues can significantly 
affect an awardee’s ability to concentrate, focus, organise themselves and keep on track with their studies.   
14.6.2.  Minor health problems are  managed  by the awardee.   
Page 114 of 148 
Australia Awards Scholarships Policy Handbook April  2023  
{A} = applicant/awardee      {P} = Program Area    (I) = institution     (S) = Global Education and Scholarships Section  
 14.6.3.  More serious or chronic health problems  (including scheduled tests or 
treatments in a hospital) will constitute welfare incidents and will impose 
responsibilities on an institution.   
14.6.4.  Because of the potential for complications and long recovery periods which may affect an awardee’s ability to c omplete their scholarship, DFAT 
strongly recommends that awardees do not undergo elective surgery whilst on -scholarship in Australia. DFAT will not approve a suspension or 
extension for an awardee who has chosen to undergo elective surgery in Australia , nor will DFAT provide any Contribution to Living Expenses for 
awardees who are unable to study for extended periods while recovering from elective surgery . 
14.6.5.  Institutions are to report all serious or chronic health problems as early as possible. Where details are not confirmed (for example if an awardee is waiting for test results) notification should not be delayed. Student 
Contact Officers can include in their notification an outline of what 
information is not yet available. The earlier DFAT  is notified the m ore likely 
it is that the awardee will be appropriately supported.  
14.6.6.  If an awardee experiences a change in their health, DFAT  has the following 
expectations . 
14.6.7.  {A} Awardees are to monitor  their own health and to manage any minor 
health problems themselves . 
14.6.8.  {A} However , awardees should report  to their Student Contact Officer  as 
soon as possible if:  
i. they have questions about the Overseas Student Health Cover  
ii. they are unsure where or how to access medical services  
iii. they are required to have medical tests which require admission to 
hospital, including day procedures;  
iv. they are diagnosed with a serious condition or a chronic illness  
v. they become pregnant and it may affect their study program; and  
vi. they are made aware that they will have to attend hospital for 
treatment in the near future.  
14.6.9.  {A} Awardees who suspend their scholarship and return home on medical 
grounds must stay in contact with DFAT and must seek prior approval from 
DFAT and their institution before returning to Australia.  
14.6.10.  {I} Institutions are to:  
i. ensure all awardees are aware of the nearest medical and counselling 
facilities, either on or close to campus, and how to access those 
facilities;  
ii. ensure awardees are aware of other health and wellbeing facilities and 
services, such as the institution’s on- campus health and fitness centre 
or local remedial therapy practices; and    
Page 115 of 148 
Australia Awards Scholarships Policy Handbook April  2023  
{A} = applicant/awardee      {P} = Program Area    (I) = institution     (S) = Global Education and Scholarships Section  
 iii. notify DFAT, as per the procedures outlined in Section 14.2 , as soon as 
they are informed that an awardee is experiencing a serious or chronic 
health issue or requires hospitalisation.  
Long- term illness  
14.6.11.  If an awardee experiences serious or chronic health problems and is unable 
to study or is hospitalised, DFAT  will continue to provide Contribution to 
living expenses payments for six weeks .  
14.6.12.  Beyond this six -week  period awardees who are unable to study due to 
serious or chronic health problems should suspend their Australia Awards Scholarship until they have recovered.  ( Refer  Section 13.4
). This does not 
apply to awardees who have undergone elective surgery  in Australia , refer  
Section 14.6.4 .  
14.6.13.  Where the awardees dependants are hospitalised due to a chronic illness and the impact may affect the awardees capacity to continue on with their scholarship, Institutions must notify Global Education and Scholarships Section  in DFAT Canberra who will mana ge on a case -by-case  basis.  
Medical costs  
14.6.14.  All awardees are provided with Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC) to meet their basic medical costs  while on scholarship. 
14.6.15.  However, OSHC may not cover all medical expenses incurred by awardees or their dependant s during their Scholarship period, coverage of pre -
existing conditions is at the discretion of the provider . 
14.6.16.  OSHC does not cover medical costs of a student while they are travelling outside of Australia (including to New Zealand) – students must arrange 
their own travel insurance for that travel.  
14.6.17.  Awardees are liable for any additional medical costs not covered by OSHC.  
14.6.18.  If an awardee or their dependant s are unable to meet their medical 
expenses in Australia, DFAT  may consider suspending their scholarship 
befor e requiring them to return home to recover. In assessing whether an 
awardee should be suspended DFAT  will consider whether, on balance, the 
cost of their medical expenses is greater than the cost of returning home.  
14.7. Death of an awardee’s family member  
14.7.1.  DFAT does not provide any form of financial assistance to awardees in the 
event that a family member dies either in Australia or overseas.   
14.7.2.  However, DFAT  understands that the death of a family member can be a 
traumatic event that may affect an awardee’s c apacity to successfully 
complete their studies.  
14.7.3.  In the  event  that an awardee’s family member dies the following additional 
responsibilities apply.   
Page 116 of 148 
Australia Awards Scholarships Policy Handbook April  2023  
{A} = applicant/awardee      {P} = Program Area    (I) = institution     (S) = Global Education and Scholarships Section  
 14.7.4.  {I} Institutions must facilitate the provision of support to the awardee and, 
when possible, any accompanying family members.  Support may include 
access to counselling services.  
14.7.5.  {I} Institutions may approve an awardee’s use of a Reunion Airfare 
entitlement in advance if the awardee needs to return home for the 
funeral of a family member. Program Areas must be notified in advance of 
an awardee’s departure date.  
14.7.6.  {I} The use of the Reunion Airfare entitlement for this purpose is to be 
recorded in the OASIS journal.  
14.8. Pregnancy 
14.8.1.  In order to maximise awardees’ chances of successfully completing their 
Australi a Awards Scholarships, DFAT  strongly recommends that pregnant 
awardees defer or suspend their award before  resuming their studies in 
Australia after the birth of their child ( refer  Sections 6. 2  and 13.4 ). 
14.8.2.  Defer ral or suspension allows awardees time to recover, to put in place 
any necessary adjustments or care arrangements, and to organise  a visa 
for their dependants  if required.  
14.8.3.  If a pregnant awardee does not defer or suspend, DFAT will not provide 
any financial assistance  beyond the standard scholarship entitlements, or 
after the scholarship end date. This includes:  
i. awardees  currently on scholarship; 
ii. completing awardees ; and  
iii. awardees waiting to give birth ; and  
iv. awardees waiting for their child to obtain a visa.  
14.8.4.  {A} On -scholarship awardees are to:  
i. notify their Student Contact Officers of their pregnancy;  
ii. consider suspending their Australia Awards Scholarship before 
resuming their studies in Australia after the birth of their child; and  
iii. keep their Student Contact Officers informed of their condition.  
14.8.5.  {I} Institutions  must ensure that all awardees are made aware of the 
nearest medical and counselling facilities, either on or close to campus, 
and how to access thos e facilities.  
14.8.6.  {I} Institutions may approve an awardee’s use of a Reunion Airfare 
entitlement in advance (if the awardee is entitled to the Reunion airfare) if 
the awardee wishes to suspend and return home to give birth. Program 
Areas must be notified in advance of an awardee’s departure date.   
14.8.7.  {I} The use of  the Reunion Airfare entitlement for this purpose should be 
noted in the OASIS journal. A medical certificate  must be cited before an 
institution approves the use of Reunion Airfare entitlement in this way.

 14.9. Referral to Counselling Services  
14.9.1.  Undertaking a scholarship in another country  present s new challenges, 
which can be stressful for awardees, especially in the initial months.  
Awardees may be  referred to counselling services to help them adjust to 
life in Australia and to the demands of Australian institutions.  
14.9.2.  All referrals to counselling services should be considered welfare incidents 
and should be dealt with in accord with the general notification and procedural requirements outlined in Sections 14 .2 and 14.3
. 
14.10.  Victim of Crime Overseas  
14.10.1.  Where an awardee is the victim of crime whilst on- scholarship but 
overseas (e.g. on holiday or  doing fieldwork) there is very little that DFAT  
can do to rectify the situation. However, DFAT  does consider these 
incidents to be welfare incidents.  
14.10.2.  {A} In addition to reporting the offence to relevant local authorities, DFAT 
advises all awardees to inform the Program Area.  
14.10.3.  {A} Awardees are responsible for organising their own travel insurance for 
travel outside of Australia.  
14.10.4.  {I} When the awardee returns to Australia, institutions must meet with the 
awardee to determine if they require access to counselling services.  
14.10.5.  {P} Program Areas  must notify the Global Education and Scholarships  
Section  and the relevant institution as per the standard procedure outlined 
in Section 14.2 . 
14.10.6.  {P} If appropriate, the Program Area  may facilitate the provision of support 
to the awardee in order to enable them to return to their studies in 
Australia.  
14.10.7.  {P} Awardees will not be entitled to financial compensation from DFAT if 
they are victims of crime overseas.  Any support provided by the Program 
Area will be entirely at its discretion.  
14.11.  Absent awardee 
14.11.1.  If an awardee has been reported to the Student Contact Officer  as not 
attending classes for  one week and all attempts by the institution to 
contact the awardee have failed, this is a welfare incident . 
14.11.2.  {S} The Global Education and Scholarships Section will: 
i. work with the institution to locate the awardee and establish their 
wellbeing  
ii. work with th e institution and Program Area  to recommend a suitable 
course of action based on the awardee’s situation and wellbeing  
iii. raise the matter to a critical incident if the awardee remains 
uncontactable in excess of two weeks

 iv. notify the necessary authorities (including the Department of Home 
Affairs  and the relevant Program Area) if the awardee cannot be 
located.

 15. Critical incidents  
15.1. What is a critical incident?  
15.1.1.  A ‘critical incident’ is a clearly defined event or situation that may happen 
to an award ee while they are on -scholarship that adversely affects, or has 
the potential to adversely affect, an awardee’s ability to successfully complete their scholarship.  
15.1.2.  DFAT ’s primary concern with any critical incident is the welfare of 
awardees.  DFAT  expects  all parties to respond to critical incidents 
effectively, professionally, and in strict adherence to the policies and procedures outlined in this chapter.  
15.1.3.  The following events or situations are always critical incidents:  
i. any suspected breach of Australian laws by an awardee, which results in 
the awardee being questioned, detained or charged with any criminal offence ; 
ii. any time that an awardee is the victim of a crime in Australia; 
iii. any time an awardee is uncontactable for two weeks;  
iv. any incidence of domestic violence involving an awardee, either as a victim or a perpetrator ; 
v. any time that an awardee is admitted to hospital in an emergency and is in a serious condition. For non -serious conditions that may include 
hospital admission, pl ease refer to Welfare Incident policy ( Chapter  14
); 
and 
vi. the death of an awardee while they are on- scholarship, in Australia or 
overseas.  
15.1.4.  This chapter outlines the notification procedures for critical incidents, the roles an d responsibilities of all parties and the response and management 
processes for all critical incidents.  
15.1.5.  This chapter delineates some responsibilities between Program Areas, managing contractors and case managers because of the sensitive nature 
of critical incidents.  However, Program Areas have overarching responsibility for ensuring compliance with the ir requirements in this 
chapter.  
15.1.6.  A welfare incident is any other event or situation (not listed in Section 
15.1.3) that adversely affects, or has the potential to adversely effect, an 
awardee while they are on -scholarship. Welfare incidents are covered in 
Chapter 1 4. 
15.1.7.  Natural disasters in Australia are outlined Chapter 1 6 of this document.

 15.2. Role of Student Contact Officers  
15.2.1.  {I} It is expected that notifications of critical incidents will generally be 
made by Institutions’ Student Contact Officers.  
i. Institutions  should have appropriate protocols in place to ensure that 
Student Contact Officers  are notified immediately should another 
area of the institution become aware of an issue before the Student 
Contact Officer .   
15.2.2.  {I} It is the responsibility of each institution to ensure that an officer will be 
availab le to respond to any critical incidents which occur when the Student 
Contact Officers are away from the office.  
15.2.3.  {I} Student  Contact Officers must notify the Global Education and 
Scholarships Section of every critical incident immediately as per the 
process es in Section 15.3 . 
15.2.4.  {I} For any incident involving awardees with disability, the institution must 
copy the Disability Support Consultant  
(disability.support@australiaawards.org ) into all emails.  
15.2.5.  {I} DFAT considers the Student Contact Officer  to be the primary contact 
for all critical incidents and expects institutions to have appropriate 
protocols in place to ensure that Student Contact Officer s are notified 
immediately should another area of an institution become aware of an 
issue before the Student Contact Officer.  In such cases, institutions must 
ensure that personal privacy concerns do not prevent Student Contact 
Officer , and through them DFAT, being made aware of critical incidents.  
15.2.6.  {I} Institutions will have regard to the impact of the critical incident on the 
wider student community and manage any negative repercussions, 
including through social media. Student Contact officers should have a 
communication strategy in place to identify so cial media allies and manage 
stakeholders among the wider community.  
Notification of critical incidents  
15.2.7.  {I} The Australia Awards Section must be notified immediately when 
institutions become aware of a critical incident that adversely affects, or 
has the potential to adversely affect, an awardee’s ability to successfully 
complete their scholarship including out of hours, on weekends and on

 15.3. Principles for managing critical incidents  
15.3.1.  The Global Education and Scholarships Section will act as the primary 
liaison between all relevant parties in the course of managing and 
responding to a critical incident.  
15.3.2.  Responses to all critical incidents involving awardees are based on the following principles:  
i. support for the awardee:  This may include medical, emotional, legal or financial support for the awardee and/or their family members ; 
ii. protection of privacy:  The privacy of the awardee should be respected. Only information that is reasonably relevant to s upporting and 
managing the awardee should be collected, used or disclosed; and  
iii. Rule of Law:  Consistency with the legal framework of the relevant State or Territory jurisdiction.  All parties will endeavour to support the 
awardee and their family to unders tand the operation of laws.  
Privacy 
15.3.3.  DFAT  respects awardees ’ privacy.  However, in order to ensure they are 
properly supported in times of crisis, DFAT  also requires the disclosure of 
critical incidents  to the extent that the welfare incident has the potent ial 
to affect the awardee’s ability to successfully complete their scholarship.  
15.3.4.  Awardees agree, when they sign their Australia Awards Scholarship 
contract, that institutions, m anaging contractors and c ase managers can 
share personal information about them  and their dependa nts with DFAT , 
including sensitive information as defined in the Privacy Act 1988. This enables institutions, managing contractors and case managers to notify DFAT  of critical incidents.   DFAT will not use or disclose the information for 
any other purpose.  
15.3.5.  DFAT  does not require full disclosure of all personal and sensitive details of 
a critical incident. DFAT  needs only enough information to understand and 
assess the risk to the awardee and to be confident that they are bei ng 
appropriately supported.  The purpose of the disclosure of information is to 
enable DFAT  and others to properly manage critical incidents affecting 
awardees and their scholarship conditions.  
Domestic and Gender -based  Violence  
15.3.6.  DFAT  takes  seriously all inc idents of domestic and gender -based violence . 
i. Awardees should be aware that domestic and gender -based violence 
constitutes an offence under Australian law.  This may be different to the legal framework in their home country.  
ii. Any incidence of domestic or g ender -based violence involving an 
awardee, either as a victim or a perpetrator, is a critical incident.   
iii. Any such incident should be dealt with sensitively and appropriately and in adherence with the procedural requirements outlined in this chapter.

 15.4. Critical incident response and management  
15.4.1.  Critical incidents are managed on a case -by-case basis.  However, there are 
some general procedures, outlined in this section, which must be followed 
for all critical incidents.  
15.4.2.  {I} The institution  should confirm key details when they notify DFAT of a 
critical incident. Ideally this should include:  
i. who the awardee is;  
ii. what happened, where and when;  
iii. the awardee’s current situation;  
iv. what support has already been provided by the institution 
v. confirmation of whether or not the awardee is presently accompanied 
in Australia, and the current situation of any accompanying family 
members; and  
vi. known next steps.  
15.4.3.  {I} Notification should not be delayed while institutions seek to fill 
information gaps.  If key details are unclear or awaiting confirmation, this 
should be highlighted as part of notification.  
15.4.4.  {I} After notification, record the critical incident as a journal note in the 
awardee’s OASIS record.   
i. The journal note  should be entered immediately after notifying DFAT 
of th e incident and should record what time DFAT was notified.  
ii. Journal notes must be clear, factual and compliant with all relevant 
State, Territory or Commonwealth legislation and regulations. 
Institutions should consider the privacy of the awardee and their 
family and ensure that personal information, and in particular 
sensitive information as defined in section 6 of the Privacy Act 1988, is 
only included in journal notes to the extent it is reasonably necessary 
to adequately describe the critical incident.   
iii. Journal notes should be updated regularly until the critical incident is 
resolved.  
15.4.5.  {I} After updating  OASIS, create and maintain a critical incident report.   
i. This report must be regularly updated until the incident is formally 
closed.   
ii. The institution must be prepared to provide the report to DFAT at 
short notice.  
iii. This report should be resubmitted to DFAT every time it is updated by 
the institution.  
15.4.6.  {I} Once an incident is formally closed the institution must ensure the 
report is complete and submit this final version to the Global Education

 ANNEX A:  
Introductory Academic Program  
The IAP is mandatory for all Australia Awards scholarship holders. The program aims to assist 
awardees  to make the transition from their home country to Australia and prepares them to 
undertake tertiary education in the Australian setting.  
The course combines an academic program, welfare and cultural understanding and assists 
awardees  to understand the Australian education system.  Awardees  will consolidate their 
language proficiency, sharpen their academic skills a nd gain an understanding of academic 
culture, particularly with reference to the tertiary institution they are attending.  
Larger institutions will conduct IAPs for Australia A wards awardees  only while some other 
institutions provide a short introductory pr ogram for Australia Awards scholars after which the 
awardees  join the broader orientation and enrolment program for all international students at 
that institution. I nstitutions with few Australia A wards scholars  may join with other institutions in 
the same geographic location to deliver a joint IAP.  
The following topics will be covered over a four  to-six-week  period, this list is not exhaustive,  and 
institutions will incorporate other institution specific activit ies: 
 an introduction to living in Australia, which includes aspects such as history, Australian and 
local culture, Australian language and ideas of tolerance ; 
 introduction to student support services staff and services including counselling, student 
loans,  student union, postgraduate student associations ; 
 a Welcome to Country and introduction to Australian indigenous culture ; 
 familiarisation with the local environment including campus tour, institution culture, 
institution services and facilities, local do’s and don’ts, local area transport ;  
 networking sessions to meet other international and domestic students and develop the types 
of friends hips that will provide them with a network to draw on during their time in Australia ; 
 institution specific requirements for academic success and good academic conduct, in 
particularly essay writing, note taking, referencing, presentation skills, critical t hinking, 
research techniques, study skills and report writing. This may also introduce awardees to the 
institutions’ remote/virtual learning systems and social media expectations ; 
 living in Australia -  opening bank accounts, an introduction to local shops and services, 
transport, campus familiarisation , student ID card, renewables, recycling and waste disposal, 
where to find embassies/consulates etc. ; 
 library and IT services available at the institution and computer skills development ; 
 accommodation – where  to find it, legal process/lease negotiation, arranging connection of 
services, obtaining furniture and household goods ; 
 understanding the Australia Awards allowances and budgeting guidance ; 
 Overseas student health cover, medical welfare and health service s in Australia ; 
 staying safe – personal security, sexual well- being, water safety and what to do in an 
emergency ; 
 government and interaction with local agencies, such as police ;   
 Australian foods and foods from home ; 
 visa issues ; 
 introductions to academic’s  supervisors and coordinators and discussions about their 
expectations ;

Australia Awards Scholarships Policy Handbook April  2023  
{A} = applicant/awardee      {P} = Program Area    (I) = institution     (S) = Global Education and Scholarships Section  
  a walking tour or familiarisation tour of the closest large town or city ; 
 discussions on family entry, childcare and schooling ; 
 sporting and interest groups ; and 
 practice in oral presentation skills, networking skills and set up social media profiles . 
It is our experience that the IAP sets awardees  up for success in their scholarship. Data from 
previous years demonstrates that awardees who do not complete their  scholarship or who fail 
academically are often those who have not completed an IAP.

 SeKuRa University scholarship scheme for Sri Lankan Students
HOME \ NEWS \
The “SeKuRa” University scholarship scheme is for Sri Lankan students of any ethnicity/ religion, pursuing their studies at State Universities. This project aims to assist university students who are facing economic difficulties to continue their studies without hindrance. The value of the scholarship is Rs.5000 per month for twelve months per annum. The students will receive this scholarship until they complete their University education. Eligibility criteria such as being undergraduate students in identified state universities, having a low annual family income, etc were considered.
This university scholarship scheme commenced in 2021 with forty students from two state Universities – the Faculty of Science of the University of Colombo and the Engineering faculty of the University of Moratuwa. In 2022 it was extended to five more Universities – University of Sri Jayewardenepura, the University of Ruhuna, the University of Kelaniya, the University of Jaffna and the University of Peradeniya. Currently, one hundred and six (106) university students receive these monthly scholarships.
A meeting was held on 25th January 2023 between the donors of the scholarships, Mr Rajitha Kariyawasan and Mrs Kumudini Kariyawasan, the Vice Chancellor of the University of Colombo, Senior Professor (Chair) H.D. Karunaratne, and the recipients of the “SeKuRa” scholarships, to discuss the objectives of the scholarship scheme. The Dean of Science, Professor Upul Sonnadara also attended the meeting. During the meeting, the Vice Chancellor expressed his sincere appreciation to the donors for their generosity and their continued patronage in the future, and Professor Sonnadara praised them for their commitment towards assisting the selected students of the Faculty of Science.

 DO NOT submit  a paper application if you have alre ady submitted an Online 
Application  
 
Instructions for completing the Scholarship Application  
 
 
(READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY  before completing the application)  
 
 
1. DO NOT APPLY unless you have passed all subjects  and have obtained a minimum of seven (7) A’s  
in the most recent G.C.E. (O/L)  examination, for the first time.  Otherwise, your application will be 
rejected. (If anyone has 6 A's, and expecting another A for a subject that results were not released yet are also eligible to apply.)  
 
2. If you have already applied using the online application , please  DO NOT SEND  the paper -based 
application form.  If you do, both appli cations  will be rejected.  
 
3. Name of Student : This name should match the name in the NI C. 
 
4. E-mail address (if available): This is important if we need to clarify anything in your application. If 
included, you should read your emails regularly and respond to them prompt ly. 
 
5. Phone number (if available) : If you have a home phone number, indicate it with area code. If you don’t 
have a home phone number, you may provide a neighbor’s, relative’s or a teacher’s phone number if you like and indicate it as such.  
 
As an example, indicate your home phone number  in Colombo area as (11) 2223333. If the phone 
number is your neighbor’s, indicate as: (11) 2223333 (neighbor).  
 
6. Date of Birth : If your date of birth is April 3rd, 1994, indicate as: 03 April 1994  (in the order: 
Date/Month/Year). Don’t write as 3.4.94 or 4.3.94 as these will be very confusing.  
 
7. GCE (O/L) exam subjects and results :  DO NOT attach any orig inals  of your exam result certificates.  
 
8. Gross monthly income  of the family : Gross income is the income before deductions such as: loan

Inability to submit the above documents or if any discrepancy is found between the submitted 
information on the application and the above documents, the scholarship will be not offered.  
 
 
Please refrain from providing incorrect information about your total family income. If you do so, do not 
forget that you are unfairly stealing the scholarship of another helpless student. Furthermore, some 
scholarship sponsors personally visit their studen ts. In such occasions, if they feel that you have 
provided incorrect information about your total family income, your scholarship will be immediately 
terminated. This could adversely affect your self -dignity forever.  
  
10. If you think the Sri Lanka -  Canada S cholarship Foundation should consider any special 
circumstances (such as: deceased parents, disabled family members, etc.) during the selection 
process, write them on the application.  
 
11. Only if you are selected, you will be informed .   
 Typically,  we receive hundreds of applications, but only a small number of applicants will be selected 
due to limited funds. Unsuccessful applicants will not be notified.  
  
12. Do not attach any other certificates related to sports, speech contests and other extra- curricular 
activities. While these are very important for  a student’s development, as it is difficult to evaluate or 
assess them, they are NOT considered in our selection process. Selections are based only on the 
GCE (O/L) exam results  and total family income (and any other special circumstances) . 
 
13. Complete your application and mail it to the following address, prior to the closing date:

Looking for scholarships in New Zealand for Srilankan students? We’ve got the list
Studying in New Zealand can become quite an expensive affair, but if you plan well in advance, you can apply to a range of scholarships offered by the Kiwi universities and colleges. Open to meritorious international students to help them fund their studies, these can be partial or fully paid, depending on the criteria, course and the institution.Many scholarships and bursaries are also offered by the New Zealand government, and various private and public establishments as well. When applying to any of these scholarships, make sure you check the criteria carefully, along with the application closing date.

What is the criteria for applying to scholarships?

The most important criterion for most scholarships is a good academic score, however, it also depends on factors such as your chosen destination, subject and level. In some scholarships, factors like extracurricular activities, and volunteering can also be used to advantage. Keep in mind that every scholarship has its own eligibility criteria. While in some, a mere application may suffice, while for others you may have to fulfil several other conditions. For instance, in research centric programs, you may have to submit written assignments. Do not hesitate to contact the university admission centre if you have any doubts.What amount of money is available through scholarships?

MA International Relations
 

A wide range of themes germane to the study of International Relations (IR) comes within the purview of the Department of International Relations. Broadly, these encompass mainstream theories, critical approaches, disciplinary histories of IR, global political economy concerns, and international normative political theory. Specifically, teaching and research is carried out by engaging in academic debates relating to security and strategic studies, peace and conflict resolution approaches, theories and practices of geopolitics with special reference to the Indian Ocean Region and Polar Regions, the study of regional and international organisations, climate change and sustainable development, and identity politics. While we are not an Area Studies Department, we share a special and abiding curiosity with regard to all facets that have a bearing on the overall texture of politics in South Asia. We encourage our Master’s candidates to think through a South Asian perspective in their research.

For the Master’s degree, which is a two-year (four semesters) academic programme, students are required to complete ten compulsory courses offered by the Department: International Relations Theory, History of International Relations, Comparative Politics, Political Theory, Security Studies, Global Economy, Introduction to Conflict Transformation and Peace-building, International Relations of South Asia, Research Methods, and International Organisations. In addition to these courses, the Department offers a range of optional courses in the third and fourth semesters for students to choose from. Students are also required to attend two courses outside of the ones offered by the Department:

A four-credit course on Academic Reading and Writing over the first and second semesters (two credits per semester) of the Master’s programme.
A two-credit course on Introduction to South Asia that provides an overview of the various facets of the region. Students are also expected to write a dissertation in the fourth semester, worth eight credits.

MA Sociology
 

MA Sociology is a two-year (four semester) programme offering a combination of compulsory and optional courses which introduce students to sociological and anthropological theories, contemporary social theory, as well as debates on thematic issues in sociology and social anthropology, enabling students to analyse social phenomena. The context, which will constitute a constant reference point for students, will be that of South Asian societies.

The programme also offers two courses in dissertation writing spread over two semesters. At the end of the second semester, students choose a theme for research and work closely with a faculty member towards writing a dissertation. The pedagogical processes involved are innovative not only in terms of using new modes of teaching-learning but also in terms of taking up new and contemporary issues and phenomena.

The courses offered in the Master's programme are unique in the sense that they develop a sociological sense of the societies in the region and thus allow students to widen their horizons of understanding. This gives our programme an edge over other sociology courses in the region.

In addition to the curricular component, the Master's programme also includes a variety of extra-curricular activities such as conversations, cinema-discussions, blogging and exhibitions, etc. The idea behind this culturally rich programme is to provide a holistic education in which sociology, culture, politics and everyday life come together.

PhD in Sociology
 

The Vision Statement of the Department of Sociology states:

The department not only provides a forum for the production of cutting-edge intellectual knowledge and exchange of that knowledge traversing across national borders in South Asia and beyond, but also strives through this knowledge to dislocate the persistence of an imposed framework emanating from the colonisation process and postcolonial politics of knowledge.

Keeping this in mind, the Department encourages research that proves its generic relevance for South Asia and makes an effort to overcome the parochial borders of existing research through a wider canvas of theorisation and possible empirical work. The topics/themes of research undertaken in the Department of Sociology tend to have a South Asian perspective, or show an adequate effort towards it. There need not always be a comparative perspective though the department encourages that researchers in MA and Ph.D programmes dwell upon the relevance of their research for South Asia. The PhD programme specifically aims at enabling research scholars to rethink, revise and rejuvenate the discipline of Sociology by effectively centring South Asia and engaging in a purposive dialogue with dominant centres of knowledge, typically associated with the West, as well as with new emergent perspectives from other parts of the world.

We invite students whose commitment as research scholars in Sociology and Anthropology reflect these concerns and interests. We are especially interested in students who will help push the bounds of Sociological and Anthropological knowledge to enable the development of a ‘South Asian Sociology’; who are aware of its diverse histories, concerns and approaches, and can initiate a rethinking of the category of South Asia without falling prey to nationalist and statist paradigms and contribute to the further development of Sociology and Anthropology as disciplines on the whole.

We are a young department and we offer students a vital space for intellectual and methodological innovation which is often not available at established departments elsewhere. Thus, our research students will play a critical role in developing new approaches as we grow as a department.

Based on the current composition of our faculty we invite students to work on diverse topics including: Anthropology of Contemporary Art, Anthropology of Folklore, Popular Culture, Performance, Media, Cinema, Music and Visual Culture, New Innovations in Sociological and Anthropological Theory and Methodology, Social Thoughts in South Asia, Sociology of Education, Politics of Knowledge Production, Gender and Sexuality, Material & Consumer Culture, Regionalism & Nationalism, South Asian Studies, Anthropology of Development, Social Stratification, Social Movements, Political Economy, Identity Politics, Violence and Conflict, Urban Anthropology, Sociological and Anthropological Studies of Economic life, Industrialisation and the World of Work, Human Economy, Ethnicity and Nationalism, Migration Studies and Diaspora, Forced Migration, Borders, Political Sociology and Historical Sociology.

In addition to the curricular component, the Ph.D programme requires research scholars to be active in a variety of extra-curricular activities organised by the Department such as conversations, symposia, cinema-discussions, blogging, and exhibitions, among others. The idea behind this culturally rich programme is to instill a holistic approach in which sociology, culture, politics and everyday life come together. 

 

Minimum Eligibility

A minimum of 17 years of education (12 years of schooling + a 3-year Bachelor’s degree and a 2-year Masters degree or 4-year Bachelors degree + a 1 year Masters degree in Sociology or related disciplines like Political Science, Economics and Business Studies, Labour Studies, Psychology, Cultural and Social Anthropology, History, Philosophy, Linguistics, Mass Communication, Journalism, Film and Television Studies, Education, Geography, Law, Social Work, Development Studies, Criminology, Archaeology, Cultural Studies, Gender Studies, Post-Colonial Studies, English, Comparative Literature, Comparative Religious Studies or Sociology of Science, Art History, Critical Theatre Studies, Aesthetics and art Production from an institution recognised by the government of any of the SAARC countries, with a minimum of 50% mark sin the aggregate or an equivalent grade.

 

Admission Procedure

Through an Entrance Test and an Interview. The candidates will be shortlisted for the interview on the basis of their performance in the Entrance Test. The minimum marks required to clear the Entrance Test will be 50%.

Those shortlisted for the interview, will have to submit a written research proposal (30 marks), a statement of purpose (05 marks) and two letters of recommendation (05 marks). The interview will carry 10 marks.

The final merit list will be prepared by totalling the marks obtained in the Entrance Test and in the Interview.

 

Letters of Recommendation: Candidates must submit 2 letters of recommendation from two individuals not related to them who can, with authority, comment on their suitability to study at the Doctoral level in Sociology. They should address the strengths and weaknesses of the candidates’ academic background up to that point; their analytical and language skills, strengths and orientations in publications (if publications are available) and creativity so far evident in the candidate’s chosen area of research etc. 

Research Proposal: Applicants are also required to submit a complete research proposal that outlines the process of the proposed research and, in general, includes the following points:

The context within which the general topic of the proposed research has been conceived;
Research questions, problems or hypothesis that the candidate hopes to explore;
A clear analysis of the comparative sources that could be used to guide the proposed research (to indicate that the candidate has read relevant material) as well as an analysis of the main approaches and findings of key literature in the field (as well as its weaknesses);
A description of the tools and methods for collecting information and data that are expected to be used, and why such tools are preferred. If required, new methods of research to overcome the limitations of existing methods can also be suggested.
The conceptual models/categories and theoretical approaches to be employed and their justification;
Case studies and samples that the candidate proposes to use and their selection criteria;
Areas where field work will be undertaken and the relevance of that location to the proposed study.
A brief explanation of how the proposed research might contribute to the existing knowledge;
A tentative timetable for the proposed research;

South Asian UniversityMessage from the President
Page- 1South Asian University (SAU) was established in 2010 with an objective of equipping the 
young minds of the South Asian region with world-class cutting edge knowledge and nurturing 
regional consciousness. It is a joint initiative of the eight member nations of South Asian 
+Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) viz. Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, 
India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
The idea of establishing SAU was mooted by the Prime Minister of India at the 13th SAARC 
Summit in Dhaka in 2005. The idea was for member countries to pool their resources for 
creation of a Centre of Excellence in the form of a university that would provide world-class 
facilities and professional faculty to students and researchers drawn from every countr y of the 
SAARC region.
The mandate of the South Asian University , as set out in the Agreement of the SAARC member 
states under which the university is set up, envisages that the choice of the programmes of 
studies to be offered at this university should:
enhance learning in the South Asian community that promotes an understanding of one 
another's perspectives and strengthen regional consciousness;
provide liberal and humane education to the brightest and the most dedicated students of 
South Asia so that a new class of quality leadership is nurtured; and
enhance capacity building of the South Asian Nations in science, technology and other 
areas of higher learning vital for improving their quality of life such as information 
technology , bio-technology and management sciences, etc.
These three elements i.e. building a culture of understanding and regional consciousness; 
nurturing a new class of liberal, bright and quality leadership and building the capacity of the 
region in science, technology and other disciplines considered vital for improving the quality 
of life of the people, therefore, form the core objectives of the South Asian University .
Located in Maidan Garhi, South Delhi, SAU currently offers Bachelor's , Master's and Research 
Programmes in Applied Sciences and Social Sciences. Unlike other universities in the SAARC 
nations, SAU offers a unique blend of multicultural and cosmopolitan experience drawing 
students and faculty from across South Asia.  SAU's distinct community of students and faculty 
make the campus enriched with diverse and innovative ideas, and also prepare the students to 
approach the world with a perspective that is distinctively South Asian, representing the 
aspirations and the needs of the region.
Presently , the university has five faculties viz. Faculty of Economics, Faculty of Legal Studies, 
Faculty of Life Sciences and Biotechnology , Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science 
and Faculty of Social Sciences. In the near future, the university will expand to accommodate 
about 13 faculties, with more than 5000 students. KNOWLEDGE WITHOUT BORDERS

Page- 5The Faculty of Economics offers a unique Master's programme 
in Economics with specialisation in Economic Development and 
a PhD programme in Economics.
The programmes introduce students to the intellectual breadth, 
theoretical rigor, and empirical skills that are necessar y for 
conducting advanced research, teaching, and working on 
issues of economic development in the South Asian region. 
With a vibrant community of scholars and students from all over 
South Asia, the Faculty strives to emerge as a major center of 
higher learning in this region. The students graduating from the 
programmes in the Faculty will be well trained to join 
academia, corporate sector , or international and national 
development agencies and policy think tanks.
The Faculty has the right mix of youth and experience. The small 
student teacher ratio, which is unparalleled in other institutions 
in this region, provides oppor tunity for students and faculty 
members to have regular personal interactions both within and 
outside classrooms.
The students have access to a well-stocked librar y, a wide 
range of electronic resources, and a state-of-the-ar t computer 
laborator y. The Faculty is also in the process of building up a 
comprehensive documentation and reference center with 
special emphasis on the SAARC region.FACUL TY OF ECONOMICS
Page- 7The study of law at South Asian University aims at an analytical 
understanding of the subjects, systems, theories and institutions 
in this field. Towards this end, the Faculty of Legal Studies has 
introduced the LL.M programme with an emphasis on 
international law and a PhD programme. It is widely known that 
international law has become the common language of 
relations between states and other subjects. Keeping this in 
view, the programme is sensitive to the perspective of South 
Asian countries. It is believed that the countries of the South 
Asian region would be able to explore new areas of 
cooperation if the study of their common legal problems is 
pursued with greater commitment. To be able to build a strong 
foundation for future research abilities of students in the region, 
the Faculty focuses on some impor tant areas of international 
law as part of the LL.M course structure.
Among the courses offered by the Faculty are: General 
Principles of International Law, International Trade Law, Law of 
International Organisations, International Human Rights Law, 
International Humanitarian, International Criminal Law, Law of 
the Sea, Private International Law, Intellectual Proper ty Law, 
and Legal Theor y and Jurisprudence. The Faculty equally 
emphasises on developing an interdisciplinar y approach to the 
study of law in general and international law in particular . 
Further, the Faculty offers some innovative courses such as 
Comparative Constitutional Law of South Asian countries.
Apart from traditional pedagogic methods of teaching, the 
Faculty adopts seminar methods, wherein weekly legal 
discourses are organised. Eminent law scholars from India and 
abroad are invited to interact with faculty and students. The 
Faculty also organises discussions on contemporar y legal 
problems, through joint seminars with other institutions. Further, 
the Faculty intends to engage the available human resources in 
the region and other parts of the world to contribute towards 
establishing centres of excellence in the field of international 
law and other impor tant fields of law. FACUL TY OF LEGAL STUDIES
Page-8 Page- 11The current millennium is the age of biological sciences. Today, 
we have the conceptual, experimental and mathematical tools 
to understand the complexity of inputs that go into the 
integrated study of the Science of Life. Also, with changing 
modes of production and climate change, the role of Life 
Sciences is increasing rapidly to the extent that our long-ter m 
wellbeing would be highly dependent on our understanding of 
the biological processes. The distinction between basic 
knowledge and its application towards the better ment of 
human existence has mostly ceased to exist.
The Faculty trains postgraduate students in a wide spectrum of 
Life Sciences. The endeavor of the Faculty is to teach the latest 
concepts and research technologies and prepare the students 
for careers in research and teaching in moder n biology and 
biotechnology . The areas covered includes Molecular and 
Cellular Biology; Biochemistr y; Biostatistics, Microbiology and 
Immunology; Molecular Medicine; Genetic Engineering 
Biotechnology in plants; Neurosciences; Cancer Biology;

AND BIOTECHNOLOGYThe Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science in the SAU aims to be a symbiosis of 
Mathematics and Computer Science. The Faculty envisages that Mathematics will act as the 
bedrock for well-founded computation, which will in turn be at the heart of all inter-disciplinar y 
activity involving Computer Science.
The Faculty has two depar tments - Depar tment of Computer Science and Depar tment of 
Mathematics.FACUL TY OF MA THEMA TICS 
AND COMPUTER SCIENCE
Depar tment of Computer Science:
Page- 12 Page- 13The Depar tment of Computer Science, established by the University in 2010, is one of the most 
vibrant depar tments in the university . The depar tment initiated its teaching activities through a 
Master's degree programme in Computer Science in 2010, and later it started the PhD 
programme in Computer Science in 2013. The depar tment is starting a Bachelor's degree 
programme from this year. For each programme, the depar tment follows a unique up-to-date 
curriculum with the aim to equip the students with theoretical and analytical skills as well as 
thorough knowledge and exper tise in the latest state-of-the art techniques in IT, so that they 
could work competently in diverse areas. To accomplish these objectives, the depar tment is 
offering PhD programme, four Masters programmes and one Bachelor programme. The 
summar y of the Masters and Bachelor programmes is:
·   2 years MTech (Computer Science) with an option for specialization in Artificial 
Intelligence & Machine Learning, and Advanced Networks & Systems
 
·   2 years MSc (Computer Science) with an option for specialization in Artificial Intelligence 
& Machine Learning, and Advanced Networks & Systems
 
·   3 years Integrated M.Sc.+MT ech (Computer Science) with an option for specialization in 
Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning, and Advanced Networks & Systems
 
·   5 years dual degree BTech-MT ech (Computer Science and Engineering)
 
·   4 years BTech (Computer Science and Engineering)
The MTech, Integrated MSc + MTech and dual degree BTech-MT ech programmes of the 
depar tment contains one year rigorous research project with an aim to strengthen and 
contribute to new research areas in the field. To facilitate research work, many high-end labs 
have been established in the depar tment.
In alignment with the fact that the university depar tments have their own responsibility to bring 
out skilled and competent professionals to face global challenges with the new insights of 
problem-solving abilities, the Depar tment of Computer Science, admitting students from all 
SAARC nations, is rendering such an impor tant responsibility by producing Computer Science 
professionals competent enough to fulfill the industrial and research needs of the SAARC 
nations. The mission of producing able and competent Computer Science professionals in the 
depar tment is being achieved due to the involvement of highly dedicated and competent 
faculty members. We are continuously progressing year after year as we are sincerely 
committed towards the goal of promoting not only the depar tment but also the institution as a 
whole. Our students have been able to make a mark for themselves in different parts of the 
world.  The Depar tment of Mathematics was established in the year 2012, with a vision of being a 
research-oriented Depar tment that would cater to the need of application oriented research in 
Mathematics. Keeping in view the applicability of mathematics across almost all disciplines, 
the depar tment started its first programme as MSc in Applied Mathematics. The up-to-date 
curriculum of this course has been so designed that after completion of the programme, the 
students would be equally equipped either to join a variety of industries or to pursue 
academics. Moreover , the depar tment is committed to keeping the curriculum dynamic so that 
the latest trend/demand of the programme would be taken care of. In 2013, the depar tment 
instituted the PhD programme. Since then, many batches of scholars have received their 
degrees and they are progressing well in their careers.
The students in the Depar tment of Mathematics are provided with a rich exposure of the latest 
research by way of organizing academic activities from time to time. The depar tment has 
organized numerous Symposiums and International Workshops. Moreover , lectures and 
seminars by eminent mathematicians are a regular feature of the depar tment.
The Depar tment has a strong team of research oriented academicians all of whom have vast 
research and teaching experience. At present, the Depar tment of Mathematics consists of 
eight regular faculty members.Depar tment of Mathematics:
The Faculty of Social Sciences at South Asian University was started in 2011. It is one of the 
most vibrant faculties in the university with a diverse student composition. With many faculty 
members of international repute, the Faculty attracts students from the region and beyond.
At present, the Faculty consists of two depar tments - Depar tment of International Relations and 
Depar tment of Sociology .FACUL TY OF SOCIAL SCIENCES
The Depar tment of International Relations at the South Asian University while attentive to the 
global lineage(s) of ideas and practices in world politics seeks to widen our appreciation of 
the content of the international by interrogating intellectual traditions within South Asia as 
embedded in the larger Asia. Simultaneously , there is an interest in engaging with 
comparative regional histories of globalisation in continents such as Latin America and Africa. 
The intent is not to simplistically extol the virtues of one kind of knowledge to the detriment of 
the other but on the contrar y to enrich our notion of the international by actively participating in 
a lively global conversation aimed at critically scrutinizing dominant discourses within the 
discipline afresh.
The faculty of the Depar tment share wide-ranging research interests. These encompass both 
mainstream theories and critical approaches to the study of International Relations, 
disciplinar y histories of IR, global political economy concer ns and international normative 
political theory. Colleagues also pursue teaching and research interests in security and 
strategic studies, peace and confiict-resolution approaches, the study of regional and 
international organisations, identity politics and the links between cognition and world 
politics. Collectively , we share an abiding curiosity with regard to all facets that have a 
bearing on the overall texture of politics in South Asia. Popular culture in South Asia as relates 
to cinema, music, cuisine, dress and languages would for instance squarely fall within our 
broad ambit of interest. We ultimately seek to build a community of scholars who normatively 
share an ontology and consciousness of being simultaneously both South Asian and global 
citizens. We invite you to embark on what promises to be a stimulating and timely intellectual 
journey.Depar tment of Inter national Relations:
Page- 14 Page- 15The Depar tment of Sociology at South Asian University began its contributions to teaching, 
training and knowledge production in 2011. The Depar tment not only provides a forum for the 
production of cutting-edge intellectual knowledge and exchange of that knowledge traversing 
across national borders in South Asia and beyond, but also strives through this knowledge to 
dislocate the persistence of an imposed framework emanating from the colonisation process 
and postcolonial politics of knowledge. Despite the passage of over fifty years since the Depar tment of Sociology:process of official decolonization began in the region, much of the readings of our problems, 
issues and histories originate from Euro American academia. This is very clearly visible when 
taking into account conceptual formulations and theoretical approaches that are utilized in 
exploring the region's social and cultural complexities. 
The Depar tment of Sociology strongly believes in the need to reformulate this situation by 
effectively centering South Asia without naively shunning thought from these established 
centers of knowledge be they in Europe or North America. We believe in an active and robust 
engagement with these issues within South Asia. In this context, through the work of its faculty 
and the research of graduate students, the Depar tment creates a forum for the newer forms of 
knowledge that comprehends and represents the South Asian context with a more 
authoritative and nuanced voice. We strongly believe in the need to actively intervene in the 
process of knowledge formation through a constant sharing of knowledge that the region 
produces as well as through interaction with the world beyond the region. The courses taught 
in the depar tment as well as the research carried out by its faculty members refiect this overall 
vision and our collective commitment towards innovation, move beyond untenable 
stereotypes, and explore a new world of knowledge within the discipline of Sociology .

Where can I study business?
More than 120 universities in the UK 
offer business courses, including some 
of the best in the world. London 
Business School is currently ranked 
seventh1 in the global university 
rankings, with the University of Oxford, 
Imperial College Business School, 
Warwick Business School and Alliance 
Manchester Business School all in the 
top 50. But wherever you choose to 
study, a UK business degree will open 
doors worldwide and give you the best 
possible preparation for a global 
career.
What is the application process?
Most International Baccalaureate 
applications require between 35 and 
38 points, with either AAA or AAB 
A-level grades. Courses typically 
request an existing humanities or 
social sciences degree and a 7.0 
overall IELTS score, with no lower than 
6.5 in any individual component.
How long does it take to 
graduate?
MBAs in the UK can be completed in 
just one academic year of full-time 
study, though there are lots of longer part-time study options also available. 
Most business-related degrees take 
three years to complete at an 
undergraduate level, with some 
running over four years to provide a 
year’s professional placement.
What is the course structure?
While different business schools set 
their own programme content, most 
business and management courses in 
the UK will follow a shared approach at 
first. This allows you to cover core skills 
such as market knowledge, staff 
management, strategy and finance, 
before specialising in areas that you 
are passionate about. The challenge-
based nature of teaching favoured in 
the UK helps to make sure everything 
you learn has relevance to real-world 
situations, so you’re ready to move 
forward more quickly within your 
chosen field.
Why is the UK a good choice for 
business?
The flexible, modular nature of UK 
business degrees, and their short 
duration, means you can access some 
of the best teaching possible and still 
get out into the world of business much 
sooner. You’ll also graduate with 
transferable skills that can be applied 
anywhere, giving you excellent value 
for money. It’s why 127,0002 business 
and administration students choose 
the UK every year.Studying Business and

business hub and is home to the 
world’s top financial city – London. It’s 
also the seventh best country to start a 
business, with 660,000 new companies 
registering in the UK every year.3 
Because the UK attracts businesses 
from all over the world, it continues to 
be a leading exporter of ideas and 
technology with a highly diverse 
multicultural talent pool. So whether 
you’re looking for a job or a place to 
start your own business, the UK is one 
of the best possible locations in the 
world to get started.
What are my work options after 
I graduate?
A UK business degree will help you 
enter a wide range of business and 
management careers after you 
graduate, from banking or advertising 
to general management and 
consultancy.The average starting salary for UK 
business graduates is £22,000, with 
many opportunities leading to positions 
that can pay well above £100,000 a 
year. Of course, if you plan on starting 
your own business, you’ll graduate well 
equipped for that journey too.
And from summer 2021, international 
students will be able to apply to stay 
and work in the UK for two years

number and are offered to a specific

competitive and are aimed largely at 
postgraduate level students. For 
undergraduate studies, scholarships, 
bursaries and partial fee waivers are 
much rarer. It is important to note the

Click here to know more07 Business and  ManagementBeyond just grades, build an 
all-round application 
Contrary to what many may think, it’s 
not always the top scorers who win 
scholarships. While academic merit is 
undoubtedly of importance, most 
universities are looking for well-
rounded, emotionally intelligent and 
unique individuals, who accord as 
much importance to honing their extra 
curriculars (be it sports, creative 
activities, volunteering, internships) as 
they do their academic records. UK 
Universities are looking for empathetic 
individuals with 21st century skills, 
individuals who are curious and look 
beyond classroom learning to make a 
difference in their world. 
Why you?
Chances are you will be among 
hundreds of scholarship applicants, as 
they are highly coveted and 
prestigious. It is important for you to 
outline what your special skills are and 
why they should choose you and 
especially, what you hope to achieve 
with this opportunity should it be given 
to you. Eligibility criteria
UK higher education institutions and 
agencies offer hundreds of 
scholarships and bursaries to students 
from across the world. Many of these 
are  very specific to certain 
nationalities, subjects, level of study, 
may even have age-limits and course 
duration specifications. Always do your 
research and check you are fulfilling all 
criteria before applying. And 
remember, check university websites, 
British Council websites and search 
extensively to ensure you are not 
missing any scholarships you could be 
eligible for. And if you’re not sure, just 
ask the university you are applying to, 
which scholarships you can apply for 
and they will always help you out.
Work hard on your application
No pressure, but you do need to get 
this one right! Work hard on your 
scholarship essay and application. 
Create many drafts, ask your teachers, 
friends, family to read them and give 
you honest feedback, and make sure 
you are answering the question “Why 
me?”. Be original, never copy from 
other applications (plagiarism is a strict 
no-no in the UK), and articulate your 
aspirations for this scholarship.Here are some tips that can help you apply for a scholarship08 Business and  Management09 Business and  Management
Learn from others
If you’re unsure about your essay or 
worried you’ve missed some 
scholarships, underconfident about 
scholarship interviews (some 
prestigious ones have interviews), find 
an alumni or current awardee in the UK, 
a senior from school or college, a 
professor or teacher or ask the 
university you want to apply to, to 
connect you to past scholarship 
winners, so they can give you helpful 
tips and mentor you.
Deadlines matter
Scholarship deadlines are almost 
always sacrosanct and applying on 
time shows you are serious about your 
application. Make a list of the various 
deadlines and stick to them, and always 
apply early if possible. 
Apply!
One of the most common questions 
from students who want to apply for 
scholarships is, “will I get it?” You 
won’t know till you apply, so always, 
always apply. Remember, scholarships 
are not reserved for geniuses with a 
high IQ, they are for students with 
clarity of thought, academic 
aspirations with a clear value 
proposition. And that can most 
definitely be you. CONTACT US IN THE  UK: IN INDIA: www.cumbria.ac.uk/international

Careers in Business and 
Management 
A business management degree 
prepares you for a career in business 
in any industry across a wide variety of 
sectors. Skills in decision-making, 
creativity in problem-solving, analytical 
thinking and effective communication 
skills will prepare you well for almost 
any career you decide to pursue. 
It is important to gain experience while 
studying courses in business 
management. You may do this through 
extracurricular activities at university 
of take up positions in clubs and 
groups that encourage team-building, 
business or finance skills. You may 
apply for part-time work in an area of 
your chosen field of work.
Think about the area in business 
management you would like to 
specialise in and try to get some 
relevant work experience.
Business Management studies has one 
of the widest job repertoires which 
means that a large number of 
industries and sectors will accept and 
even prefer employees with a business 
management degree. 
Some jobs related to business 
management are:
Accountant, business adviser, business 
analyst, consultant, corporate banking, 
data scientist, stock market analyst, 
actuaries, chartered management, 
insurance, project manager, 
stockbroker, and many more.There are many other jobs where your 
degree can be extremely useful, such 
as, auditor, human resources, logistics 
and distribution manager,  marketing, 
retail and sales, systems analyst, 
broker, teacher or lecturer amongst 
others.
These roles exist across various 
sectors such as manufacturing, Fast 
Moving Consumer Goods, fashion and 
retail, utilities, healthcare, travel and 
tourism, and more and across the 
private, public, and voluntary sectors.
  Many employers accept applications 
from graduates with different academic 
backgrounds and skills learnt in a 
business management course is always 
in demand, so do not restrict your 
ambitions to the roles mentioned here.
Many large employers offer graduate 
training schemes which focus on 
commercial roles. While many prefer 
experience across a number of 
departments/ skill sets, there are 
others who prefer specialisation in 
particular fields such as marketing or 
finance.
The skills you will learn
Studying a business management 
degree will help you develop an 
understanding of corporate, public and 
private business organisations and will 
provide you specialist knowledge in 
customer behaviour, finance, 
operations, sales, retail, human 
resources, communication, information 
technology and business policy and 
strategy. 12 Business and  ManagementYou will learn transferable skills around 
understanding organisational 
behaviour and structure, critical 
thinking, problem solving, decision-
making, communication skills, 
analytical and creative approach 
towards business issues, researching 
and analysing business and financial 
data, managing time, resources and 
projects effectively, cause and effect of 
economic changes among other skills.
Academic futures: 
Many graduates choose to study 
further in marketing, finance, human 
resources, computing and international 
business management, to specialise 
and grow their proficiency in specific 
areas of business. Undergraduates may 
choose to study a masters, many move 
on to study an MBA. Postgraduates 
may also choose to pursue a PhD in a 
specific topic in business management 
and later may pursue a career in 
academia. 
Many prefer to study a professional 
qualification while working, and these 
are often encouraged and even 
sponsored by employers. Professional qualifications are provided by 
organis ations such as the:
• Chartered Management Institute
• Institute of Leadership and 
Management
• The Chartered Institute of Marketing
• Chartered Institute of Personnel 
and Development (CIPD)
• Institute of Chartered Accountants 
in England and Wales (ICAEW)
• Chartered Institute of Management 
Accountants (CIMA)
The wide range of choices in careers in 
business management can make it 
difficult to choose a specific course or 
area of specialisation. Think about what 
you enjoy and weigh in against what 
you are good at and how you would like 
your career to shape up, the 
employability prospects in that field 
and available job role s in that sector.

Discover the 
University of DundeeWhat is the Graduate route and who 
is eligible for it? (and who will not be, 
eg distance learning students, those 
who arrive after 21 June / 27 
September etc)
The Graduate route is the UK’s new 
post-study work opportunity that will 
be available for graduates from eligible 
universities in the UK. It will be two 
years long (or three years for Doctoral 
students) and gives eligible students 
the right to work, or look for work, 
whilst in the UK. The university you 
study at has to be registered with the 
Home Office with a track record of 
compliance (you can check this on Gov.
UK) and you have to be studying at 
undergraduate level or above. You 
won’t be able to apply for the Graduate 
route from anywhere outside the UK, 
and dependants (e.g. spouses or 
children) can only apply for the 
Graduate route if they are inside the UK 
with a valid Student Dependant visa 
also. Furthermore, you can only avail 
the Graduate route once per individual 
– it won’t be possible to repeatedly 
switch from Student visas to the 
Graduate route, for example.  The 
Covid concession allows for students 
who have commenced a course in 
autumn 2020 via distance learning to apply for the Graduate route, provided 
they are in the UK by 21 June 2021. 
Students who started their studies in 
Janaury/February 2021 must be in the 
UK by 27 September 2021 to apply for 
the route.
From when does it come into effect 
and what about students affected by 
Covid 19 restrictions? 
It will be introduced on 01 July 2021, 
and anyone who has a valid student 
visa (either the old Tier 4 visa or new 
Student route visa) will be able to apply, 
if they are in the UK with a valid visa at 
the time of introduction and 
successfully complete an eligible 
degree course at undergraduate level 
or above. 
Relating to Covid-19, the UK 
Government has confirmed that 
students can study online for the 
duration of the 2020-21 academic year. 
As part of that, students will still be 
eligible for the Graduate route as long 
as they are in the UK by 21 June 2021 
and then complete their course inside 
the country. Students who started their 
course in January/February 2021 will 
need to be in the UK by 27 September 
2021 to be able to apply for the 
Graduate route.Graduate route and  
Student route
Harry Booty, UKVI International 
Communications Lead, UK Visas and 
Immigration answers most common 
questions about Graduate route and 
Student route.16 Business and  ManagementWhat benefits do I get from the 
Graduate route?
The new Graduate route represents a 
fantastic improvement for international 
students, who will now get more time 
to work, or look for work, after their 
studies in the UK. You do not need to 
be sponsored (e.g. you do not need a 
job offer) and can work at any skill level 
for any salary. This gives you more 
flexibility to begin your career in the 
UK, start earning money and explore 
different avenues for employment in 
the UK, rather than being tied to a 
single employer. 
An important thing to note however is 
that it is a one-time two year (or three 
year for doctoral students) visa only, 
and it doesn’t count towards 
settlement. To stay in the UK longer, or 
count time towards applying to 
permanently settle in the UK, you will 
be able to consider other routes – such 
as the Skilled Worker, Start Up, 
Innovator or other visa routes.
What is the student route and how 
does it affect students from south 
Asian countries
The new Student route opened on 5 
October 2020 and replaced the old Tier 
4 student route. All students applying 
for courses within the UK, who are 
aged 16 or over will apply for the new 
Student route. This has similarities with 
the old route, for example around 
language and finance. However, it 
becomes simpler in several notable 
ways. Most importantly, students will be 
able to apply up to six months before 
their course starts if they are applying 
from outside the UK– meaning they can 
sort their visa in good time before they 
need to travel. Furthermore, it will be 
easier for students to extend their Student visa inside the UK, if they 
wish to continue their studies (e.g. 
opting to do a masters after 
completing an undergraduate 
course).
What are some tips to ensure I get 
my visa approved? 
Our main advice is to apply as early 
as possible. It takes about three 
weeks to get a response on your visa 
application (though it may be possible 
to pay for Priority or Super Priority 
visa service to get a response 
quicker, depending on where you 
are).
Our second main point of advice is to 
check your visa application and 
supporting documents thoroughly 
before submitting. Sometimes people 
get rejected for not meeting our 
basic requirements – for example not 
having money for 28 days before 
applying or not supplying evidence of 
English language proficiency. Visiting 
GOV.UK or speaking to your university 
about the information needed and 
ensuring to meet this is a simple way 
to maximise your chances of success.
Finally, we’d say, don’t worry too 
much! The vast majority of applicants 
are successful, and genuine students 
have nothing to worry about from our 
visa process. It may be that we ask 
for further information or even an 
interview – however, if you are able to 
come along, talk to us fluently in 
English and explain your plans and 
intentions for studying in UK, you 
shouldn’t be troubled by the 
experience.17 Business and  Management18 Business and  Management

Covid-19 Guidance for International 
Students
Do I need to get an IELTS test for my 
UK student visa?
All students must be able to speak 
English to a high standard to be 
granted a Student visa. In official 
language, this to B2 standard under the 
Common European Framework of 
Reference to study at degree level or 
above or B1 level to study below degree level , or CEFR. In practice, this 
means high proficiency or near-fluency.
Whether students will be required to sit 
a IELTS test or not depends on the level 
of study that is being undertaken and 
the type of sponsor the study will be 
conducted at. Students studying below 
degree level must pass an IELTS test. 
For students studying at degree level 
or above UK universities do have 
discretion about how they test English, 
and may offer different options for you 
to show your English proficiency to 
them. This differs from institution to 
institution so it is best to check directly 
with your chosen university. However 
you prove your English will be shown 
on the Confirmation of Acceptance of 
Studies, which you need to apply for 
your visa. You will need to provide the 
evidence of English language ability 
that the CAS references as part of your 
visa application.

Msc Marketing & Technology at 
Goldsmiths was the first choice when I 
was looking for a master’s course to 
sharpen my expertise. Working for five 
years in Tokyo at an art foundation, 
fashion company, and a one of the Big 
Five consulting firms, I was determined 
that my passion is to become a 
marketer specialised in the creative 
industry. This course has given me 
opportunities to not only theoretically 
develop my knowledge but also 
practically learn and achieve skills that 
I can apply in the real world 
immediately after I graduate and 
pursue my professional goal.23 Business and  Management

I found out about Goldsmiths through a 
friend. After working in the non-profit 
sector, I was looking to enhance my 
management skills through a business 
masters program that was also 
creative. The Management on 
Innovation MSc offered the 
combination of excitement and 
practical tools I was looking for. The 
campus atmosphere is really friendly, 
and London is filled with cutting edge 
cultural experiences. After graduation, 
I’d love to become a Project Manager 
or Innovation Consultant for social 
enterprises and community 
organizations.

I came to Goldsmith University hoping 
for good education, but was rewarded 
with practical knowledge and 
experiences that I had only dreamt of.
Being the youngest amongst my peers 
I was a bit nervous about the amount 
of experience that I brought to the 
table. Yet it was that very aspect that 
made the learning so much more 
meaningful and fun as my ideas fitted 
in well with veterans from various 
creative worlds studying with me. “A 
new and unconventional approach” 
they called it- the thing that I, myself 
needed as an Indian to try and better 
the creative and cultural scenes in my 
country. Our mentors guided us 
through this course wonderfully and I 
will be eternally grateful for their role in 
my journey.
The MA in Creative and Cultural 
Entrepreneurship taught me how to 
effectively address social and cultural 
issues with creative media. After my 
course, I worked as the Chief Script 
Writer for a firm in India, where one of 
my projects was to conceptualize

The United Kingdom offers you a world-
leading education system, with accredited UK qualifications that can make a real difference to your career. The UK is an exciting, inspiring place with a long history of cultural and creative achievements. This has allowed us to develop some of the world’s best industries for creative professionals, from art and theatre to advertising and television – each one fed by university degrees that know exactly how to foster emerging talent, with a direct link to industry. 
The UK Government has also recently 
announced the Graduate route which will enable international students to remain in the UK for two years (three years for PhD graduates) after they have completed their degrees. Students applying to graduate in the summer of 2021 or after will be eligible for this.
This publication will help you 
understand more about studying Creative Arts and Design in the UK, how these subjects are taught at universities and colleges, scholarships available, what the requirements are for students, and what sort of career paths students can pursue after completing their course. We hope this information will give you the confidence and knowledge you need to realise your creative pursuits.
Do remember that there are more than 2000 Art and Design degrees in the UK, and four of the best performing arts universities in the world. These are available across many UK universities, colleges and conservatories and you can find out more about them, compare and study various institution profiles and offers here .  
In the academic year 2019-20, there were over 69,000 students from South Asia studying in the UK, where the outstanding contribution that students from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh,  Sri Lanka and Nepal make to the international student community is greatly valued and celebrated. 
I sincerely hope that this Creative Arts 
and Design publication can help you make crucial decisions about your higher education plans and I wish you every success in making the most of your opportunity to study in the UK. 
Good Luck!

Guildhall School of Music and Drama (seventh) and University of Oxford (ninth)

and creative facilities around the country, it’s the ideal choice for a global career. 
How long does it take to 
graduate?
Most Creative Arts undergraduate 
degrees will take around three years to complete in the UK, with many offering opportunities for a year’s work experience and study abroad. Postgraduate degrees are usually between one and two years.What kinds of specialisms are 
there?
With everything from universities and 
colleges to specialist conservatoires, there’s a very wide range of Creative Arts courses in the UK, making it easy to find a career-focused curriculum that interests you. UK Creative Arts degrees include:
• film and animation
• photography
• fine art
• 3D design and textiles
• music
• drama
• dance

But whatever course you study, the 
modular structure of UK courses means you can specialise as you go. This also helps to make them more compact, so you can often graduate a lot sooner than you would in other countries.
What is Creative Arts teaching 
like in the UK?
The flexible nature of study in the UK 
means you’ll learn to think creatively from day one. We have some outstanding teachers who will share their expertise and help you learn your craft, while also fostering academic rigour and a strong knowledge of the

Contrary to what many may think, it’s 
not always the top scorers who win scholarships. While academic merit is undoubtedly of importance, most universities are looking for well-rounded, emotionally intelligent and unique individuals, who accord as much importance to honing their extra curriculars (be it sports, creative activities, volunteering, internships) as they do their academic records. UK Universities are looking for empathetic individuals with 21st century skills, individuals who are curious and look beyond classroom learning to make a difference in their world. 
Why you?
Chances are you will be among hundreds of scholarship applicants, as they are highly coveted and prestigious. It is important for you to outline what your special skills are and why they should choose you and especially, what you hope to achieve with this opportunity should it be given to you. 
Eligibility criteria
UK higher education institutions and agencies offer hundreds of scholarships and bursaries to students from across the world. Many of these are  very specific to certain nationalities, subjects, level of study, may even have age-limits and course duration specifications. Always do your research and check you are fulfilling all criteria before applying. And remember, check university websites, British Council websites and search extensively to ensure you are not missing any scholarships you could be eligible for. And if you’re not sure, just ask the university you are applying to, which scholarships you can apply for and they will always help you out.
Work hard on your application
No pressure, but you do need to get this one right! Work hard on your scholarship essay and application. Create many drafts, ask your teachers, friends, family to read them and give you honest feedback, and make sure you are answering the question “Why me?”. Be original, never copy from other applications (plagiarism is a strict no-no in the UK), and articulate your aspirations for this scholarship.Here are some tips that can help you apply for a scholarship14 Creative Arts and DesignLearn from others
If you’re unsure about your essay or 
worried you’ve missed some scholarships, underconfident about scholarship interviews (some prestigious ones have interviews), find an alumni or current awardee in the UK, a senior from school or college, a professor or teacher or ask the university you want to apply to, to connect you to past scholarship winners, so they can give you helpful tips and mentor you.
Deadlines matter
Scholarship deadlines are almost always sacrosanct and applying on time shows you are serious about your application. Make a list of the various deadlines and stick to them, and always apply early if possible. 
Apply!
One of the most common questions from students who want to apply for scholarships is, “will I get it?” You won’t know till you apply, so always, always apply. Remember, scholarships are not reserved for geniuses with a high IQ, they are for students with clarity of thought, academic aspirations with a clear value proposition. And that can most definitely be you. 15 Creative Arts and DesignCreative economy  
scholarships
We know from the current British 
Council, FICCI and Art X Company creative economy research, Taking the Temperature  the impact of the Covid-19 
pandemic on the creative industries in India is serious. Arts Management and effective culture policy at Government level is more important than ever at present.
There is limited Higher Education 
programmes in the creative economy, arts management or cultural policy in India and the expertise in this area is at a low bar. Arts organisations are increasingly reliant on charitable giving, philanthropy and draw-down of free reserves to survive the coming months as the depth of the crisis extends into 2021.
To address this need, the British Council 
India is delighted to offer the opportunity to study creative economy in UK with the 
• Goldsmiths, University of London in

• The University of Glasgow Creative Industries and Cultural Policy in Msc (two scholarship)
Details about these scholarships and the application process will be available (for the September 2021 academic year) on the British Council website by mid-April. These details will also be available on the 2021 webpage of the respective universities very soon. 
These Creative Economy Scholarships 
will address limited opportunities in the academic sphere in India by providing opportunities to candidates to complete a master’s degree in the United Kingdom.
Further 2022 is the anniversary of 
India’s 75th year of Independence and planning is starting toward a UK-India season. The first cohort of Creative Economy students will graduate in summer 2022 forming an important nexus of cultural ambassadors for the 2022 programme. The Ambassador role for the Creative Economy scholars in support of the 2022 UK-India Season offers further opportunity to develop the skills of the scholars as future arts leaders and producers - central to strengthening the creative economy in India and South Asia.

in the worldCareers in Creative Arts  
and Design
The UK is an exciting, inspiring place 
with a long history of cultural and creative achievements. This has allowed us to develop some of the world’s best industries for creative professionals, from art and theatre to advertising and television – each one fed by university degrees that know exactly how to foster emerging talent. 
Arts and design careers can lead to a 
wide range of careers, which may include art industry jobs, selling and promoting art, working in public spaces like museums and galleries. There are also jobs in academia and in community work such as using arts for informal learning with different groups of society e.g. prisoners, young people, children, families, people who are differently abled.
Utilising design skills and artistic vision in 
sectors like architecture, fashion, media, digital AR/VR, film, music and theatre are career choices for many after studying an arts and design subject.
Given the wide range of courses 
available, careers in arts and design can include Film and Animation, Photography, Fine Art, 3D design and textiles, Music, Drama, Dance, Creative writing / screen writing, Graphic Design, Set and Costume Design, Lighting and Sound Design though not restricted to just these career paths. Many Arts and Design courses will explore the use of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) in their curriculum.
From universities and colleges to 
specialist conservatoires, you can find career-focused Creative Arts courses that will develop key specialisms in a career that excites you.The Arts and design has a strong industrial link with most courses created to provide a direct route to a related career. The key areas of employment are arts and design, education, local government, events and leisure, travel and tourism, media and public relations, performing arts, voluntary organisations and business management among others. 
In most careers in arts and design it is 
advised to have a strong portfolio of work to showcase your talent and skills to prospective employers, including your original ideas and from your coursework. Networking will be crucial to your career and do look for ways to present your work in public spaces and with peers. Think about putting your work out there and enter competitions and exhibitions, be open to critiques and connect with alumni and industry professionals as much as possible. 
Being able to evidence your 
commitment to developing a career in the arts as a young professional will be an important criterion to consider when applying for UK Higher Education study. You may consider volunteering at festival or gallery, or write, create and make your own art, you may have interned with an theatre group or craft organisations – these would all be useful examples of your commitment to academic study in the UK for a  long-term career in the arts.

creative-arts18 Creative Arts and DesignWhat is the Graduate route and who 
is eligible for it? (and who will not be, eg distance learning students, those who arrive after 21 June / 27 September etc)
The Graduate route is the UK’s new 
post-study work opportunity that will be available for graduates from eligible universities in the UK. It will be two years long (or three years for Doctoral students) and gives eligible students the right to work, or look for work, whilst in the UK. The university you study at has to be registered with the Home Office with a track record of compliance (you can check this on Gov.UK) and you have to be studying at undergraduate level or above. You won’t be able to apply for the Graduate route from anywhere outside the UK, and dependants (e.g. spouses or children) can only apply for the Graduate route if they are inside the UK with a valid Student Dependant visa also. Furthermore, you can only avail the Graduate route once per individual – it won’t be possible to repeatedly switch from Student visas to the Graduate route, for example.  The Covid concession allows for students who have commenced a course in autumn 2020 via distance learning to apply for the Graduate route, provided they are in the UK by 21 June 2021. Students who started their studies in Janaury/February 2021 must be in the UK by 27 September 2021 to apply for the route.
From when does it come into effect 
and what about students affected by Covid 19 restrictions? 
It will be introduced on 01 July 2021, 
and anyone who has a valid student visa (either the old Tier 4 visa or new Student route visa) will be able to apply, if they are in the UK with a valid visa at the time of introduction and successfully complete an eligible degree course at undergraduate level or above. 
Relating to Covid-19, the UK 
Government has confirmed that students can study online for the duration of the 2020-21 academic year. As part of that, students will still be eligible for the Graduate route as long as they are in the UK by 21 June 2021 and then complete their course inside the country. Students who started their course in January/February 2021 will need to be in the UK by 27 September 2021 to be able to apply for the Graduate route.
Graduate route and  
Student route
Harry Booty, UKVI International 
Communications Lead, UK Visas and Immigration answers most common questions about Graduate route and Student route.19 Creative Arts and DesignWhat benefits do I get from the 
Graduate route?
The new Graduate route represents a 
fantastic improvement for international students, who will now get more time to work, or look for work, after their studies in the UK. You do not need to be sponsored (e.g. you do not need a job offer) and can work at any skill level for any salary. This gives you more flexibility to begin your career in the UK, start earning money and explore different avenues for employment in the UK, rather than being tied to a single employer. 
An important thing to note however is 
that it is a one-time two year (or three year for doctoral students) visa only, and it doesn’t count towards settlement. To stay in the UK longer, or count time towards applying to permanently settle in the UK, you will be able to consider other routes – such as the Skilled Worker, Start Up, Innovator or other visa routes.
What is the student route and how 
does it affect students from south Asian countries?
The new Student route opened on 5 
October 2020 and replaced the old Tier 4 student route. All students applying for courses within the UK, who are aged 16 or over will apply for the new Student route. This has similarities with the old route, for example around language and finance. However, it becomes simpler in several notable ways. Most importantly, students will be able to apply up to six months before their course starts if they are applying from outside the UK– meaning they can sort their visa in good time before they need to travel. Furthermore, it will be easier for students to extend their Student visa inside the UK, if they wish to continue their studies (e.g. opting to do a masters after completing an undergraduate course).
What are some tips to ensure I get 
my visa approved?  
Our main advice is to apply as early as possible. It takes about three weeks to get a response on your visa application (though it may be possible to pay for Priority or Super Priority visa service to get a response quicker, depending on where you are).
Our second main point of advice is to 
check your visa application and supporting documents thoroughly before submitting. Sometimes people get rejected for not meeting our basic requirements – for example not having money for 28 days before applying or not supplying evidence of English language proficiency. Visiting GOV.UK or speaking to your university about the information needed and ensuring to meet this is a simple way to maximise your chances of success.
Finally, we’d say, don’t worry too 
much! The vast majority of applicants are successful, and genuine students have nothing to worry about from our visa process. It may be that we ask for further information or even an interview – however, if you are able to come along, talk to us fluently in English and explain your plans and intentions for studying in UK, you shouldn’t be troubled by the experience.

Do I need to get an IELTS test for my 
UK student visa?
All students must be able to speak 
English to a high standard to be granted a Student visa. In official language, this to B2 standard under the Common European Framework of Reference to study at degree level or above or B1 level to study below degree level , or CEFR. In practice, this means high proficiency or near-fluency.Whether students will be required to sit a IELTS test or not depends on the level of study that is being undertaken and the type of sponsor the study will be conducted at. Students studying below degree level must pass an IELTS test. For students studying at degree level or above UK universities do have discretion about how they test English, and may offer different options for you to show your English proficiency to them. This differs from institution to institution so it is best to check directly with your chosen university. However you prove your English will be shown on the Confirmation of Acceptance of Studies, which you need to apply for your visa. You will need to provide the evidence of English language ability that the CAS references as part of your visa application.21Emily Hebe Mitchell, BA (Hons)

Meet Pradyuman Samant, a 2020 
Marine and Natural History Photography BA graduate of Falmouth University.
Prady started taking pictures of wildlife 
when he was only 11 years old so he knew that he wanted to find a university course where he could continue to pursue and develop his passion. He says that going to Falmouth has been one of the best decisions he has ever made because it has opened doors to so many opportunities that would not have been possible otherwise. When asked to sum the whole experience up, he says ‘Best 3 years of my life - I wish I could go back and do it all again’
When Prady was doing his research 
into universities in England he found that Falmouth University ticked all the boxes he was looking for in an English university. It is also one of the only universities to have a degree in marine and natural history photography degree in the world.  
He was really impressed by the 
facilities and the equipment that students have access to in the Institute of Photography, one of just nine departments at the University. He says ‘The University offers the students so much; from massive studios to £1.5 million worth of photography equipment. I used everything I could in my 3 years there and I absolutely loved 24

it. It’s the experience that I couldn’t get anywhere else.’
Prady was also very excited by the 
student life that the University offers. The support that is offered to international students was important to Prady when choosing a university, so it is something that he really did a lot of research into. He says ‘The culture that this university and Falmouth as a place has is just super unique. The people are so nice, and the tutors are always there to help no matter what. I don’t think there is any other university where tutors are always there for you 24/7. Every member of staff is always happy to help.’Creative Arts and Design
Falmouth University  When asked how Prady felt about 
moving to Cornwall, as opposed to somewhere like London where many international students base themselves, he said has no idea about what Cornwall would be like but once he did a little more research and discovered what a naturally beautiful place it is, he knew it was where he wanted to be. When he arrived at Falmouth, he instantly knew that he had indeed made the right decision and that Falmouth is a great place to live and study. When asked about what the best thing, outside of studying, was about being in Falmouth, he says ‘It has to be 5am Beach walks. I love to be in nature and having 3 beaches like 5 mins away from my house was the best part’
Now that Prady has graduated, does he 
think that having a degree from an English university will help him with his future career? Prady is positive that it will and that he has already started to see a return on his investment. He says 
‘Having an English degree has its perks in the industry. People are immediately impressed when you say you studied at Falmouth University in the UK. It’s made getting a job in Mumbai so much easier’
Prady is originally from Mumbai 
(India), and has lived there since he graduated from Falmouth University in June 2020. He is currently working on a documentary about plastic pollution in India in collaboration with an award-winning director, as well as a under-wraps project with a Falmouth course tutor. Other than that, Prady is working on his Instagram content: follow him on @pradysamant and  @pradyumansamant. You can also check his website  www.pradyumansamant.comCreative Arts and Design 25All the students are so warm, they all 
make everyone feel included, especially being an international student. Goldsmiths feels like home. Within a month I started feeling comfortable and well adjusted in London. After graduating I am hoping to go back to India and do great changes using the knowledge I gained from Goldsmiths. I am so glad that I chose to come to Goldsmiths for my education.Alumni profiles
Before I came to Goldsmiths, I was a student in India and was completing my high school degree. While I was still in high school I started doing a lot of research for which university to apply for, and then I had a feeling that Goldsmiths was the one for me.
What really excited me to join 
Goldsmiths was the BA Design programme. This course is helping me explore different areas of design, and I really like how everything is integrated, and it’s not just the basic, standard design course. It has really helped me broaden my horizons and think outside the box. I am learning things that I never imagined myself doing, like merging coding with design – this really fascinates me. The technical studies and the project briefs are really engaging and interesting. I really love the tutors and how friendly and helpful they are. It feels more like a friendly relationship than a student professor relationship.
 The atmosphere in and around the 
college is very warm. There is so much diversity everywhere, it’s astounding. 26

(Extension Degree)“I’ve heard of Goldsmiths while studying my A-Levels in London. My art teacher highly recommended the university to me, regarding it as one of the most open-minded and forward-looking in the whole of Britain. I now know that he was completely right!
My journey to becoming a Goldsmiths 
student has started with the open day. I tried to think critically and compare the quality of the art workshops to what I saw in the other universities. By the time I saw the studious I was almost sure, that I want to study here but then the studios stole my heart. Big and bright, they seemed like a perfect place to create.
After the decision was made I started 
working really hard to prepare an online portfolio worthy of my future course. I’ve also focused on my studies aiming to get A-A* in all of my subjects. Just thinking about my future course was pushing me forward in my studies. Knowing that the fine art course in Goldsmiths is very free and self-driven I started working more independently, preparing myself for the struggles I was going to face. I also thought carefully about my art practice and approach to life overall and tried remodeling my routine to fit the university lifestyle. I have since become much more free in the expression of my ideas, and have developed my research and comprehension skills.
Now, a month into my studies, I am 
starting my new life full of new ideas and chances to take. Having been given almost complete freedom on my course I’ve learned to constantly 
search for new opportunities to enrich my knowledge and unleash my creativity – the college atmosphere really helps me with this! There is always somebody organising an interesting talk or discussion, putting on a performance, or exhibiting their work. I feel like being set free to express themselves the Goldsmiths students really take the creative opportunity to go beyond the limits and create something amazing.  
The whole area around Goldsmiths is filled with young musicians, writers, and artists interconnecting their practices and constantly inspiring each other. Sometimes it feels like creative individuals are just drawn to Goldsmiths.
I love the eruptive energy of London 
and see a lot of creative potential in the New Cross area in particular. Here is the place where I want to work and grow as an artist and be inspired by the people, who are growing alongside me.”Creative Arts and Design 27Alumni pr ofiles
I am so thrilled to reflect on my Leeds 
experience and dive into the waters of nostalgia. I graduated with an MA in Writing for Performance and Publication in 2017. The year-long masters programme gave me an opportunity to focus on experimenting with my own writing styles and skills. It also encouraged me to think critically about my work while analysing it in comparison to existing pieces of literature. I found my professors to be very interesting in their own ways— all of them were very approachable and brought something different to the table.
The School of Performance and 
Cultural Industries has ties with various arts and creative organisations and this allowed me some wonderful opportunities. I was commissioned to co-write a play called ‘Dressed in Time’ for the Marks & Spencer Archive on campus. The play traced the history of the company and brought alive the people involved with the inception of the company. It was performed for over 300 people at the West Yorkshire Playhouse; covered on television, newspapers, online and performed in Bradford the following year. 
Through a guest lecturer, I got the 
opportunity to work with Theatre Company Blah Blah Blah on a collaborative radio play based on the Partition of India that aired on Chapel 28

FM. It was a very personal experience and I received a Silver Arts Award from Trinity College London for my work. 
I was also quite involved with a couple 
of student societies run by the Leeds University Union (one of the best student unions in the country). My poems were published in all four issues of Volume 4 of ‘The Scribe’ and I co-wrote a play for The Open Theatre Society. I also volunteered with Leeds Marrow for a few weeks and my role was to spread awareness about Leukaemia and assist people in signing up to become stem cell donors. Additionally, I worked with Joblink on an ad-hoc basis, helping out at the Help & Advice Desk at the union and at a few University career fairs. Creative Arts and Design
University of Leeds 
Leeds is a very student-oriented city, 
conveniently located at the centre of the UK. Aside from attending the many trips put together by the union, I managed to travel widely during my time in the UK, adding a wealth of experiences to my journey, especially as a writer. I’ve lived in large Indian metropolitan cities all my life, so I found Leeds to be just the right balance of happening and peaceful. The 
countryside was mesmerising and Yorkshire is a beautiful region.
I will always cherish my time at 
Leeds. I met some wonderful people along the way and gained exposure I couldn’t have anywhere else. All of it has played a huge role in turning me into the person I am proud to call myself today.

design, we’re interested in defining it.

It’s not about rigidly positioning you as a particular type of designer (e.g. product, graphics, interaction) – instead you’ll explore topics and issues affecting society right now that require a responsive, fluid and collaborative approach to design.

David Swansea College of Art  Founded in 1853
Swansea College of Art at University of 
Wales Trinity Saint David was founded over 170 years ago and has a distinguished tradition; described in Peter Lord’s The Visual Culture of Wales as ‘the most successful and prestigious art school in Wales’. Today we are at the forefront of creativity and employment.
We respect and celebrate our 
traditions, which is why we have retained traditional equipment and processes. We are also forward-looking, and our buildings are bristling with new technology. We pride ourselves on the experience students receive, graduate prospects are at the forefront of what we offer and the amount of contact time students get with staff is also among the highest in the country. Swansea is a great place to study Art & Design, a seaside city, embracing the creative power of water: big enough to offer you the space you need; small enough to make you feel that you belong. Enjoy an art school experience in a contemporary university at Swansea College of Art, part of University of Wales Trinity Saint David (UWTSD).

10Economics
Ignite y our car eer with economics
The UK has helped shape the face of 
modern economics, inspiring both ho w it's 
applied in pr actice and ho w it's taught 
around the globe. So if y ou w ant to 
understand ho w – and why – mone y 
makes the w orld go r ound, ther e's no 
better place to star t your studies and giv e 
your car eer a kick-star t.   
A unique economic history
There's a long heritage of analysing 
mark ets in the UK, one that goes back 
hundr eds of y ears, but it's Scottish think er 
Adam Smith who is most widely cr edited 
as cr eating the ﬁeld of modern 
economics. Countless other theorists 
since Smith ha ve been born in the UK, or 
else inspir ed by it, fr om Friedrich Engels 
and Karl Marx to John Ma ynard Keynes, 
the champion of fr ee mark et laissez fair e 
economics. 
Today, studying economics in the UK is a 
chance to pick up that same journe y, and 
it can of fer the star ting point to a 
fascinating car eer. Economics pla ys a big 
role in almost e very aspect of life, and a 
good understanding of ho w people, 
companies, and countries think about and 
contr ol their w ealth can be inv aluable to 
many emplo yers. 
From the w ay that mone y ﬂows thr ough 
global systems to the psy chology behind 
personal spending, our academic thinking 
and our economic heritage – not to 
mention ha ving the ﬁf th biggest economy 
in the w orld – all help mak e sur e that UK 
economics gr aduates ar e alw ays in high 
demand. World-class teaching fr om da y one  
If you're looking for the v ery best 
economics teaching, y ou'll ﬁnd much of it 
here in the UK. W e're home to thr ee of the 
world's best univ ersities for economics – 
the L ondon School of E conomics and 
Political Science (ﬁf th), the Univ ersity of 
Oxfor d (ninth) and the Univ ersity of 
Cambridge (tenth). 
With mor e than 1 00 univ ersities of fering 
over 1200 courses, y ou w on't struggle to 
ﬁnd some wher e you can giv e your car eer 
the lif t you're looking for . 
You w on't just be learning about past 
theories; y ou'll be helping to shape ne w 
ones too. Many of our univ ersities ha ve 
strong international r eputations in k ey 
areas of contempor ary economic 
resear ch – so y ou'll be taught b y people 
who ar e shaping the ne xt gener ation of 
ideas. W ith the incr easingly global and 
integr ated natur e of economics, 
international perspectiv es ar e mor e 
impor tant than e ver, so y ou'll be joining a 
debate wher e your v oice and opinions ar e 
highly v alued. 
What to e xpect
Most economics degr ees split learning 
across tw o strands – micr oeconomics and 
macr oeconomics. Micr oeconomics is the 
study of ho w individual par ties such as 
people, gr oups, and businesses appr oach 
using their w ealth, while macr oeconomics 
looks at entir e economies. So, y ou will 
leave with a r obust understanding of 
economics on a wide spectrum, fr om the 
largest to the smallest possible scale. Humanities and Social Sciences 11History of economic thought
You'll look closely at the w ay that 
economic thought has e volved thr oughout 
history , informing the appr oaches of 
governments, businesses and other 
organisations. Fr om the k ey think ers to 
the landmark milestones, y ou'll ha ve a 
good kno wledge of the w ay that 
economics has got to wher e it is, so y ou'll 
be w ell placed for a car eer that helps to 
take it forw ard.   
Beha viour al economics  
A key aspect of y our studies will concern 
human decision making when it comes to 
wealth. The psy chology of spending can 
be enormously impor tant when 
accounting for system modelling and 
theories, so y ou'll be thinking about all the 
social and personal implications of 
economics, fr om game theory to w elfare 
and consumer choice. 
Get the skills y ou need to e xcel
You'll be able to de velop a wide r ange of 
exceptional tr ansfer able skills, fr om 
analysis and statistics to r esear ch and 
presentation – the kinds of skills that 
emplo yers ar e sear ching for , and that y ou 
can apply to pr ofessional challenges 
anywher e in the w orld. Popular car eers for economics 
graduates include:
Actuarial analyst
Char tered accountant
Compliance of ﬁcer
Data analyst
Economist
External auditor
Financial risk analyst
Investment analyst
Political risk analyst
Risk manager
Statistician
Stockbr oker
Follow in some pr estigious footsteps 
The UK has a long heritage of educating 
world leaders, many of which choose 
economics as their primary focus. W ith 
social policy and ﬁnancial mark ets making 
up par t of many economics degr ees, it 
can open up car eers at the highest le vel. 
So ther e really is no limit to what y ou can 
achie ve.

speciﬁc topics such as mark ets, prices 
and inter est rates. E conomics on the other

joint-honours degr ees to choose fr om, 
wher e economics is combined with 
related subjects such as law , history , and 
politics.
What will the course co ver? 
Most under graduate economics degr ees 
will spend the ﬁrst y ear pr oviding k ey 
insights into the tw o separ ate w ays of 
looking at economics – micr oeconomics 
and macr oeconomics. Macr oeconomics 
looks at entir e economies, while 
microeconomics looks at ho w individual 
people, gr oups, and businesses, appr oach 
using their w ealth. Y ou will also co ver 
mathematics, pr obability and the history 
of economics, among other things. As y ou 
progress thr ough y our course y ou will 
have the chance to specialise in the ar eas 
that inter est y ou, whether that's 
international economic gr owth, political 
economics, or something entir ely 
different. Whate ver you choose, y ou will 
be able to de velop str ong tr ansfer able 
skills, such as pr oblem solving, data 
analysis, written and or al presentation, 
and analy tical thinking.Humanities and Social Sciences 14Why is the UK a good choice for

The UK is w ell-kno wn as the country 
wher e modern democr acy ﬁrst took r oot 
during the 1 3th century , in the form of the 
world's ﬁrst elected parliament. The 
Palace of W estminster , which stands on 
the site of W illiam the Conquer or's ﬁrst 
palace, has a unique place in the w orld's 
shared understanding of democr acy and 
government. That history has allo wed the 
UK to establish an unbeatable cultur e of 
excellent in political teaching. 
From the pr ominent v oices of the 
Enlightenment, such as John L ocke and 
Thomas Hobbes, to the political 
visionaries and activists lik e Emmeline 
Pankhurst who helped to inspir e modern 
political thinking, the w orld has alw ays

over and studying at a pr ovider that is not 
an independent school will apply for the 
new Student R oute (those y ounger going 
for education will apply for a Child Student

several notable w ays. Most impor tantly , 
students will be able to apply up to six

What do I need to do to get my Student 
visa? 
You should apply as early as possible. It 
can tak e thr ee w eeks to get a r esponse on 
your visa application (though it ma y be 
possible to pa y for Priority or Super 
Priority visa service to get a r esponse 
quick er, depending on wher e you ar e). But 
if you can, apply one month or mor e in 
advance of y our date of tr avel. 
You should also check y our visa 
application and suppor ting documents 
thoroughly befor e submitting. Sometimes 
people get r ejected for not meeting our 
basic r equir ements – for e xample not 
having mone y for 28 da ys befor e applying 
or not supplying e vidence of English 
language pr oﬁciency . Visiting GO V.UK or 
speaking to y our univ ersity about the 
information needed and ensuring to meet 
this is a simple w ay to maximise y our 
chances of success.Finally , we'd sa y, don't w orry too much! 
The v ast majority of applicants ar e 
successful, and genuine students ha ve 
nothing to w orry about fr om our visa 
process. It ma y be that w e ask for fur ther 
information or e ven an intervie w – 
however, if you ar e able to come along, 
talk to us ﬂuently in English and e xplain 
your plans and intentions for studying in 
UK, y ou shouldn't be tr oubled b y the 
experience.

Do I need to get an IEL TS test for my 
UK student visa ?
All students must be able to speak English 
to a high standar d to be gr anted a Student 
visa. In of ﬁcial language, this is to B2 
standar d under the Common Eur opean 
Framework of R eference to study at 
degr ee le vel or abo ve or B1 le vel to study 
below degr ee le vel, or CEFR. In pr actice, 
this means high pr oﬁciency or near-
ﬂuency .
Whether students will be r equir ed to sit a 
IELTS test or not depends on the le vel of 
study that is being under taken and the 
type of sponsor the study will be 
conducted at. Students studying belo w degr ee le vel must pass an IEL TS test. F or 
students studying at degr ee le vel or 
above UK univ ersities do ha ve discr etion 
about ho w the y test English, and ma y 
offer dif ferent options for y ou to sho w 
your English pr oﬁciency to them. This 
differs fr om institution to institution so it is 
best to check dir ectly with y our chosen 
university . However you demonstr ate y our 
English pr oﬁciency will be sho wn on the 
Conﬁrmation of Acceptance of Studies, 
which y ou need to apply for y our visa. Y ou

As an International Af fairs Analyst for CNN 
in Br azil, I need to analyse curr ent w orld 
politics in r eal-time. The MA International 
Relations at Goldsmiths, Univ ersity of 
London pr epared me w ell for this. It ga ve 
me the analy tical tools that ar e key to my 
job and made me stand out in the 
competitiv e job mark et in the ﬁrst place. 
During my studies, I learned to analyse 
contempor ary international r elations fr om 
a variety of critical perspectiv es. In the 
seminars, my lectur ers of ten pushed me 
to think cr eativ ely outside the bo x.
Beyond theories and academic analyses, 
the course also of fered me the possibility 
to sharpen my job pr oﬁle and gain r eal-
world e xperience during a w ork 
placement module. As par t of my studies, I thus w orked for a 
human rights or ganisation on the situation 
of conﬂict and peace in Colombia. In 
doing so, I gained r elevant e xperience in 
advocacy on human rights, international 
development and peace building, 
including informing British MPs about the 
situation in Colombia. I thus feel that the 
MA International R elations at Goldsmiths 
offered the perfect combination of theory 
and pr actice.

Alumni Pr ofiles38I decided to attend Goldsmiths, Univ ersity 
of London primarily because of the 
academic r eputation for my course, as it 
had a str ong emphasis on clinical pr actice 
and r esear ch methods. I learned about the 
university while sear ching on the  internet 
and then visited the of ﬁcial w ebsite to 
look at mor e information. I w as truly 
impressed with the faculty pr oﬁle and the 
course curriculum as it w orks 
exceptionally w ell with what I am seeking 
for in a pr ogram. Befor e coming to 
Goldsmiths, I had completed my Masters 
in Applied Psy chology fr om St Agnes 
College, Mangalor e, and w as working as 
an Assistant Counselling Psy chologist at 
Dhany a Doctor's Chamber , Kochi. 
I found the course to be r emark ably 
interesting as it deals with a v ast v ariety of 
subjects. I am also looking forw ard to the 
clinical placement as its dir ect e xperience 
of working within clinical psy chology and 
health service settings.  I also lik ed the 
whole fr amework of the course and ho w 
everything that is taught is immediately 
uploaded on the VLE page. The college 
atmospher e is friendly and w elcoming. I 
liked the div erse community that mak e up 
the student body on campus as ther e are 
so many people fr om v arious cities, states, 
and e ven countries. I also lik ed that ther e is a dynamic r ange 
of clubs and societies to tak e par t in.
My initial da ys when I arriv ed in L ondon 
were quite lonely as it w as a ne w place 
and I w as extremely nerv ous about the 
course and college. But soon af ter a fe w 
weeks, I made a lot of friends, learned the 
course structur e and curriculum and also

suggested I go for LLM fr om one of 
esteemed univ ersity in England and I 
started the pr ocess. The 1 8 months 
masters pr ogramme ga ve me an 
oppor tunity to focus on e xperimenting

enhance her capacity as an asset to the

from BRA C Univ ersity , as a Merit Scholar 
(2015-18) and has had the privilege to

Her dedication to the de velopment sector

improving, ho wever, ther e is r oom for 
growth. In this light, amid a plethor a of 
multifaceted de velopment concerns, 
Aishw arya, as of no w, aspir es to specializ e 
in gender issues. Her master's disser tation 
focused par ticularly on the study of men 
and masculinities with r eference to the 
male r eady-made garments w orkers in 
Bangladesh – which is a domain that is 
relativ ely under-r esear ched. The thought-pr ovoking thesis elabor ates 
on ho w in de velopment pr actice gender 
issues tend to be de void of men and 
masculinities-concerns and ho w said 
concerns must be incorpor ated in 
international de velopment interv entions 
since concepts of masculinities and

hence bring about gender equality

is not only a Russell Gr oup Univ ersity but

oppor tunity to learn and e xperience a 
multicultur al life. It has r eally helped me

and within a month I star ted feeling

with the change in my life but I soon 
began to get a gr asp of things. My student 
life became far mor e engaging once I 
managed to ﬁnd a balance betw een my 
academic and social life. Our mentors 
guided us thr ough this course w onderfully

I was for tunate to spend my ﬁrst semester

my entir e second semester shif ted 
towards online learning. E ven af ter the 
dramatic outbr eak of CO VID-1 9, the 
University didn't compr omise in its 
educational quality and made the 
transition to online lectur es much 
smoother . Living abr oad has not only helped me gain 
the much needed educational e xposur e 
but also helped me become mor e 
independent, made me mor e self-
sufﬁcient in making my decisions. The 
experiences I ha ve gather ed during my 
masters ga ve me the oppor tunity to build 
my self-conﬁdence, impr ove my 
leadership qualities, and gr ow as a person. 
I have had the oppor tunity to mak e 
wonderful friends who became no less 
than family . The y made the nationwide 
lockdowns during this pandemic 
surviv able. The best memories, outside of 
studying, w as the late night laughter and 
gatherings with friends. 
When something comes to y ou with 
difﬁculty , you value it mor e. My sta y in the 
U.K w as a shor t time, and I w anted to 
make the most of it. L ooking back in time, 
those w ere the best y ears of my life, I wish 
I could go back and do it all again. On the

institutions also cultiv ate industry 
relationships, allo wing y ou to get pr actical 
experience in y our ﬁeld within w orld-
leading or ganisations, and mak e

Shor t, ﬂexible courses
In the UK, ﬂe xibility is built into the 
majority of our courses. Many univ ersities 
allow you to choose fr om dif ferent subject 
‘modules’, so y ou can build a course 
programme that ﬁts y ou best, specialising 
as you go for a perfectly tailor ed 
experience.Postgr aduate courses in the UK ar e 
shorter than both the US and Austr alia, 
with many MB A’s taking just one y ear. So 
you get better v alue for mone y and can 
begin applying y our kno wledge in the r eal 
world a lot sooner .
A ne w way of learning
Our educational system doesn’t just 
immerse y ou in y our chosen subject – it’ s 
designed to help y ou to think dif ferently . 
Throughout y our studies y ou’ll be 
encour aged to ask questions, debate 
your teachers and fello w students, and 
come up with y our o wn ideas thr ough a 
blend of pr actical learning, lectur es and 
seminars and inno vative, high-tech 
teaching. Behind our courses and 
degr ees ar e brilliant think ers, some of the 
best minds in their ﬁelds who y ou can

The impact that their suppor tive inspiring 
teaching has is e vident in the feedback 
we receiv e from our postgr aduates. 93 
per cent of international postgr aduates 
rate the quality of UK teaching highly .
Medicine, Dentistry and allied subjects 06World-leading r esear ch
We’re ranked second in the w orld for 
science and r esear ch and 54 per cent of 
our output is w orld- leading. Our ﬁeld-
weighted citation impact is higher than 
the US, Canada, Germany , Japan and

police of ﬁcers and campus-based security 
staff will giv e you pr actical advice about

one of the most adv anced healthcar e 
systems in the w orld. The NHS pr ovides

which is why international students do not 
need priv ate medical insur ance.
As par t of y our visa application, y ou will

Options
The academic y ear
In the UK, the standar d academic y ear 
starts in September or October and runs 
until June or July . 
Postgr aduate courses of ten run fr om 
September to September , and ther e are 
other courses that ar e mor e ﬂexible and 
offer a r ange of star t dates.
Subjects and modules
Most higher education courses ha ve a 
‘modular’ structur e. This means that y ou 
can build a personalised course b y 
choosing modules or units of study fr om 
different subject ar eas. F or example, if y ou 
are studying English liter ature, for y our 
ﬁrst y ear y ou could choose one module 
on Science ﬁction, one module on 
Childr en’s liter ature, and one module on 
Shor t stories.
If you ar e inter ested in mor e than one 
subject, y ou ma y be able to study a 
combination as par t of y our course, e.g. 
English liter ature and psy chology . You can 
often decide for y ourself ho w much time 
you w ould lik e to spend on each subject. 
‘Joint’ means the tw o subjects ar e studied 
equally , ‘major/minor’ means the time 
spent is usually 75 per cent/25 per cent.Study modes
Most full-time under graduate courses tak e 
three years to complete (typically four 
years in Scotland). Full-time postgr aduate 
courses can be fr om one y ear up wards.
Some degr ees ar e available to study as 
acceler ated courses tak en over tw o years 
instead of thr ee, so that y ou can gain y our 
qualiﬁcation e ven faster . Acceler ated 
degr ees ha ve the same amount of 
modules as their thr ee year options, 
allowing y ou to get e ven better v alue for 
mone y by getting the same course with a 
year less of living cost.
Part-time courses ar e normally tak en over 
a longer period, so that y ou can w ork 
alongside y our studies or learn at a mor e 
relaxed pace. If y ou need a visa to study 
in the UK, please check that y our

Medicine, Dentistry and allied subjects 09Applying to medical school in 
the United Kingdom
Medicine is an e xciting car eer with tw o 
days ne ver being the same, wher e every 
patient is an individual and ther e is a 
chance to learn something ne w every da y. 
If you ar e passionate about studying to 
become a doctor , you've come to the 
right place!
Applying to a medical school in the UK is 
quite dif ferent to other courses and it is 
impor tant that y ou familiarise y ourself 
with the application pr ocess w ell in 
advance to allo w yourself enough time to 
submit y our application.One of the k ey dates to k eep in mind is 
the UCAS application deadline for 
medicine, which is in October - this is 3 
months earlier than for other courses and 
it is impor tant that y ou submit it on time.
It is impor tant to r emember that e very 
medical school is dif ferent. This is true 
about both their selection pr ocess as w ell 
as ho w the course is taught. It is crucial 
that y ou spend some time going thr ough 
this information on their w ebsite befor e 
deciding wher e to apply .An experience of a student fr om India
Author: Sai Ram Pillarisetti, 
Final Y ear Medical student & National Pr esident, BID A Student W ing – 
A division of the British International Doctors Association (BID A) 
Medicine, Dentistry and allied subjects 10Another k ey consider ation is what 
standar dized test y our univ ersity uses to 
screen applicants. This could either be the 
UKCAT (United Kingdom Clinical Aptitude 
Test) or the BMA T (BioMedical Admissions 
Test). E ach univ ersity has its o wn 
preference so it is impor tant to r ead 
around what these tests ar e about and 
which ones y ou might ha ve to sit.
You will also need to dr aft a personal 
statement. This is a written piece that 
explor es why y ou w ant to study medicine, 
your achie vements so far and why y ou ar e 
the right type of person for the course. 
A good w ay to sho w your commitment to 
studying medicine is b y under taking some 
relevant w ork e xperience. This could 
involve shado wing a doctor at a hospital 
or clinic wher e you will ha ve the 
oppor tunity to see ﬁrst-hand the w ork-life 
of a doctor . Shado wing a doctor can be 
difﬁcult to arr ange and don't be 
disappointed if this is not possible. Y ou 
can under take work e xperience in any 
healthcar e setting, and it can be with any 
member of a healthcar e team - such as a 
nurse or par amedic. 
Wher ever you under take your w ork 
experience it is impor tant to include y our 
experiences in y our personal statement. 
Rather than just listing the activities y ou 
did, I w ould encour age y ou to also r eﬂect 
on your e xperiences, y ou can write about 
a par ticularly thought-pr ovoking episode 
and ho w it made y ou feel or what it made 
you realise.Once y ou ha ve submitted y our application 
and completed the UK CAT/BMA T, you must 
wait to see if y our application has been 
shortlisted for an intervie w. This can of ten 
be an anxious time, but it is impor tant to 
stay positiv e! Ther e are several free online 
resour ces and books which can help 
prepare you for the intervie w.
If you ar e successful at y our intervie w, the 
university will giv e you a conditional of fer 
to study at their institute. This conditional 
offer will usually state a minimum scor e in 
your ﬁnal school e xams - each univ ersity's 
requir ement can be found on their 
website.
If you get of fered a place to study 
medicine in the UK – w ell done! If not, do 
not be dishear tened and r emember to 
never giv e up on y our dr eams, y ou can 
always work on y our application and r e-
apply the follo wing y ear.
Finally , it is impor tant not to get 
overwhelmed b y the application pr ocess 
and to enjo y your journe y to becoming a 
medical student and e ventually , a fully 
qualiﬁed doctor . I wish y ou all the best of

Visas and Immigr ation answ ers most common questions 
about Gr aduate R oute and Student R oute.Medicine, Dentistry and allied subjects 25What beneﬁts do I get fr om the 
Graduate R oute ?
The ne w Gr aduate R oute r epresents a 
fantastic impr ovement for international 
students, who no w get mor e time to w ork, 
or look for w ork, af ter their studies in the 
UK. Y ou do not need to be sponsor ed (e.g. 
you do not need a job of fer) and can w ork 
at any skill le vel for any salary . This giv es 
you mor e ﬂexibility to begin y our car eer in 
the UK, star t earning mone y and e xplor e 
different a venues for emplo yment in the 
UK, r ather than being tied to a single 
emplo yer. 
An impor tant thing to note ho wever is that 
it is a one-time tw o year (or thr ee year for 
doctor al students) of fer only , and it 
doesn't count to wards settlement. T o sta y 
in the UK longer , or count time to wards 
applying to permanently settle in the UK, 
you will be able to consider other r outes – 
such as the Skilled W orker, Star t Up, 
Innovator, Global T alent or other visa 
routes.What is the Student R oute, and ho w 
does it af fect students fr om South 
Asian countries?
The ne w Student R oute opened on 5 
October 2020 and r eplaced the old T ier 4 
Student R oute. All students applying for 
courses within the UK, who ar e aged 1 6 or 
over and studying at a pr ovider that is not 
an independent school will apply for the 
new Student R oute (those y ounger going 
for education will apply for a Child Student 
Route). This has similarities with the old 
route, for e xample ar ound language and 
ﬁnance. Ho wever, it becomes simpler in 
several notable w ays. Most impor tantly , 
students will be able to apply up to six 
months befor e their course star ts if the y 
are applying fr om outside the UK– 
meaning the y can sor t their visa in good 
time befor e the y need to tr avel. 
Furthermor e, it will be easier for students 
to extend their Student visa inside the UK, 
if the y wish to continue their studies (e.g. 
opting to do a masters af ter completing 
an under graduate course).
Medicine, Dentistry and allied subjects 26What do I need to do to get my Student 
visa? 
You should apply as early as possible. It 
can tak e thr ee w eeks to get a r esponse on 
your visa application (though it ma y be 
possible to pa y for Priority or Super 
Priority visa service to get a r esponse 
quick er, depending on wher e you ar e). But 
if you can, apply one month or mor e in 
advance of y our date of tr avel. 
You should also check y our visa 
application and suppor ting documents 
thoroughly befor e submitting. Sometimes 
people get r ejected for not meeting our 
basic r equir ements – for e xample not 
having mone y for 28 da ys befor e applying 
or not supplying e vidence of English

speaking to y our univ ersity about the

this is a simple w ay to maximise y our

The v ast majority of applicants ar e 
successful, and genuine students ha ve 
nothing to w orry about fr om our visa

however, if you ar e able to come along,

comes fr om a humble back ground of

degr ee in Medicine fr om Aligarh, Uttar

of “building a healthier society b y 
preventing diseases at population le vel, 
rather than curing it in hospitals” . He 
therefore wanted to equip himself with 
right kno wledge, qualiﬁcation, and public 
health skills, which he w ould apply to r eal

He w as advised b y his seniors to go to 
public health schools in United Kingdom 
(UK) for the purpose. Ho wever, coming 
from a middle-class family , and 
considering the cost inv olved, going to UK 
for higher studies w as a distant dr eam. 
Running in his dr eam, he disco vered that 
UK univ ersities of fer a plethor a of 
scholarships to international students 
coming fr om lo w-middle income countries. 
Dr Kazmi applied for se veral scholarships 
and for tunately got Commonw ealth 
Shared Scholarship, which co vered all 
costs of his education in UK. He still fondly 
remembers the date 1 3th April 20 15, 
when he r eceiv ed email conﬁrming 
“Commonw ealth Scholarship A ward” from 
Finance Suppor t Ofﬁcer of the Univ ersity

“Sometimes things happen, which divides 
your life into tw o par ts: your life befor e 
the incident and y our life af ter it. 
Receiving Commonw ealth Scholarship to 
study in UK w as that deﬁning moment of 
my life which changed e verything for 
good” , says Dr Kazmi.The scholarship helped Dr Kazmi, r ealize 
his dr eam and he ﬁnally r eached UK for 
his postgr aduate degr ee pr ogram, which 
was rewarding in many w ays. “Students 
from acr oss the w orld conv erge to UK 
universities which enrich classr oom 
discussions, e xpose y ou to div erse

campus. Fur ther, the curriculum format 
encour ages r esear ch and inno vation, 
which serv e as “boiling br oth” of ne w

I am delighted to present the Study UK Scholarship Guide 
2020 for students from South Asia who are exploring funding options, bursaries and grants for their study plans in the UK.
The United Kingdom offers you a world-leading education 
system, with UK qualifications that can make a real difference to your career. A strong reputation for research and education, UK universities and colleges attract the world’s leading academics and industry professionals. Studying in the UK will also give you the opportunity to experience a new culture, network with students and professionals from all over the world, and gain skills to help further your career development. 
While pursuing your plan to study in the UK, many of 
you will be exploring various financial support options which are available to help fund your studies in the UK. This includes scholarships, grants, bursaries, fellowships, financial awards and loans. These can help you achieve your ambitions and set you on the path to your dream career.
The UK Government has also recently announced the 
Graduate Route which will enable international students to remain in the UK for two years (three years for PhD graduates) after they have completed their degrees. Students applying now to graduate in the summer of 2021 or after will be eligible for this.
This guide provides a listing of some general scholarships 
available for South Asian students across various subjects and levels, as well as some useful advice around applying to and studying in the UK, information on student visas, IELTS, and some exciting alumni stories that will give you first-hand accounts of pursuing and successfully winning scholarships to study in the UK. We have also featured a few UK universities and colleges in the guide with details of their scholarships for students in the region. However, do remember that almost all UK universities and colleges provide hundreds of scholarships worth millions of pounds to international students and you can find out about specific institutions and agencies offering funding here .  
There were almost 40,000 students from South Asia studying in the UK in 2018-19 and the UK appreciates the outstanding contribution that students from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal make to the international student community in the UK. I hope that this guide can help you with your education plans and I wish you success in making the most of your opportunity to study in the UK. Please always reach out to your local British Council office for any queries or support. Good Luck!

Short, flexible courses
In the UK, flexibility is built into the majority of our courses. Many universities allow you to choose from different subject ‘modules’, so you can build a course programme that fits you best, specialising as you go for a perfectly tailored experience.
Postgraduate courses in the UK are shorter than both 
the US and Australia, with many MBA’s taking just one year. So you get better value for money and can begin applying your knowledge in the real world a lot sooner.
A new way of learning
Our educational system doesn’t just immerse you in your chosen subject – it’s designed to help you to think differently. Throughout your studies you’ll be encouraged to ask questions, debate your teachers and fellow students, and come up with your own ideas through a blend of practical learning, lectures and seminars and innovative, high-tech teaching.
Behind our courses and degrees are brilliant thinkers, 
some of the best minds in their fields who you can connect with.
The impact that their supportive inspiring teaching 
has is evident in the feedback we receive from our postgraduates. 93 per cent of international postgraduates rate the quality of UK teaching highly.  World-leading research
We’re ranked second in the world for science and research and 54 per cent of our output is world-leading. Our field-weighted citation impact is higher than the US, Canada, Germany, Japan and Brazil, so when you study here you can be sure you’ll be working alongside some of the best minds – and using some of the best technology-  in the world.
Health and safety
The UK is a very safe country with low levels of crime and violence. Your university/institution will brief you about keeping safe and staff are always on hand to help ensure your safety. Community police officers and campus-based security staff will give you practical advice about personal safety.
The UK’s National Health Service (NHS) is one of the 
most advanced healthcare systems in the world. The NHS provides first-class treatment and support and you can access the NHS at a subsidised rate which is why international students do not need private medical insurance.
As part of your visa application, you will pay an 
Immigration Health Surcharge that allows you to use the NHS for most physical and mental illnesses, including emergency services and care for Covid.

Blended learning
Large audience teaching (lectures) will be delivered online, in cases supported by online discussions and face-to-face study in small groups will be made safer through ‘bubbles’. Courses with practical teaching sessions will be delivered in a safe way with physical distancing and personal protective equipment.Many UK institutions are developing exciting and innovative examples of high-quality online learning. Tier 4 sponsors can sponsor international students for blended learning for the 2020-21 academic year.
Health and well-being:
The health and wellbeing of international students is our number one priority and UK universities are working to ensure that they are safe and supported.
A programme ensuring mental health support for 
students during Covid-19 has been created by Student Minds, the UK’s mental health charity for students. Universities are putting measures in place to make sure campuses are clean and completely compliant with government guidelines. The UK government provided Covid-19 guidance for cleaning of non-healthcare settings, covering student accommodation and other spaces within the community. The timing of teaching is being carefully considered with flexible timetabling to avoid too many students on campus.
For full information, check your university or 
institution’s website as plans may change, depending on the current public health advice.
Letter to prospective International 
students:
Here’s what the Education and Universities Ministers 
of the four countries of the United Kingdom (UK), 
England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have to say to the prospective International students.
11The academic year
In the UK, the standard academic year starts in 
September or October and runs until June or July. Postgraduate courses often run from September to September, and there are other courses that are more flexible and offer a range of start dates.  
Subjects and modules
Most higher education courses have a ‘modular’ structure. This means that you can build a personalised course by choosing modules or units of study from different subject areas. For example, if you are studying English literature, for your first year you could choose one module on Science fiction, one module on Children’s literature, and one module on Short stories.
If you are interested in more than one subject, you may 
be able to study a combination as part of your course, e.g. English literature and psychology. You can often decide for yourself how much time you would like to spend on each subject. ‘Joint’ means the two subjects are studied equally, ‘major/minor’ means the time spent is usually 75 per cent/25 per cent.
Study modes
Most full-time undergraduate courses take three years to complete (typically four years in Scotland). Full-time postgraduate courses can be from one year upwards.
Some degrees are available to study as accelerated 
courses taken over two years instead of three, so that you can gain your qualification even faster. Accelerated degrees have the same number of modules as their three year options, allowing you to get even better value for money by getting the same course with a year less of living cost.
Part-time courses are normally taken over a longer 
period, so that you can work alongside your studies or learn at a more relaxed pace. If you need a visa to study in the UK, please check that your immigration  status allows you to do a part-time course.

14Here are some tips that can help you apply 
for a scholarship
 
 
  
Beyond just grades, build an all-round application 
Contrary to what many may think, it’s not always the 
top scorers who win scholarships. While academic merit is undoubtedly of importance, most universities are looking for well-rounded, emotionally intelligent and unique individuals, who accord as much importance to honing their extra curriculars (be it sports, creative activities, volunteering, internships) as they do their academic records. UK Universities are looking for empathetic individuals with 21st century skills, individuals who are curious and look beyond classroom learning to make a difference in their world. 
Why you?Chances are you will be among hundreds of 
scholarship applicants, as they are highly coveted and prestigious. It is important for you to outline what your special skills are and why they should choose you and especially, what you hope to achieve with this opportunity should it be given to you. 
Eligibility criteriaUK higher education institutions and agencies offer 
hundreds of scholarships and bursaries to students from across the world. Many of these are  very specific to certain nationalities, subjects, level of study, may even have age-limits and course duration specifications. Always do your research and check you are fulfilling all criteria before applying. And remember, check university websites, British Council websites and search extensively to ensure you are not missing any scholarships you could be eligible for. And if you’re not sure, just ask the university you are applying to, which scholarships you can apply for and they will always help you out.Work hard on your application
No pressure, but you do need to get this one right! 
Work hard on your scholarship essay and application. Create many drafts, ask your teachers, friends, family to read them and give you honest feedback, and make sure you are answering the question “Why me?”. Be original, never copy from other applications (plagiarism is a strict no-no in the UK), and articulate your aspirations for this scholarship.
Learn from othersIf you’re unsure about your essay or worried you’ve 
missed some scholarships, underconfident about scholarship interviews (some prestigious ones have interviews), find an alumni or current awardee in the UK, a senior from school or college, a professor or teacher or ask the university you want to apply to, to connect you to past scholarship winners, so they can give you helpful tips and mentor you.
Deadlines matterScholarship deadlines are almost always sacrosanct 
and applying on time shows you are serious about your application. Make a list of the various deadlines and stick to them, and always apply early if possible. 
Apply!One of the most common questions from students 
who want to apply for scholarships is, “will I get it?” You won’t know till you apply, so always, always apply. Remember, scholarships are not reserved for geniuses with a high IQ, they are for students with clarity of thought, academic aspirations with a clear value proposition. And that can most definitely be you. 
15Internships and work experience
Having a form of work placement experience gives you 
an advantage in an increasingly competitive graduate job market.
Some courses include a year of working in the industry 
or internships in the industry you’re interested in. Work placements provide you with hands-on experience in a profession that you can’t simulate in lectures or the classroom.
In this short film , watch international students from 
Coventry University share their experience of working 
at Brompton Bicycles.  
Plan for your career
All UK universities and colleges employ professional career advisers to give advice on how to plan your career, build your CV and prepare for interviews. 
Careers advisors can help you focus on developing the 
skills needed to succeed in particular industries. By honing in on specific attributes which will make you more employable, you will stand out amongst others. There are lots of UK based organisations that offer excellent careers planning and support. See the links below for organisations that can help you discover where your UK qualification could lead.
With many multinational companies headquartered 
in the UK, for example, GlaxoSmithKline, Vodafone, Unilever, BP, Shell, Tesco and Aviva, our universities and institutions maintain strong links with these and many other industries.
Our teaching methodology incorporates industry-
led learning approaches and students benefit from practical work and courses that understand current practices and demands. With many UK courses, this means you can undertake an internship or a work placement while you study.
Post Study work opportunities 
There are lots of options available to international students who want to stay and work in the UK after their studies.
If you’re considering staying in the UK after your 
studies, you may need to apply for a separate visa to your student visa. You can check whether you need a visa at UK Visas & Immigration .
Working part time while you study:
If you are over 16 and have the right visa, it is easy to find a part-time job while you are studying in the UK.
Typically, you will be able to work for up to 20 hours 
during term time. Check your visa and residence permit paperwork for details on what part-time work you can do. Check with your university, in case there are any part-time work restrictions relating to your course.  
The Graduate Route
From summer 2021, international students who have successfully completed an undergraduate or master’s degree will be able to benefit from two years’ work experience in the UK upon graduation, through the new Graduate Route. Students who complete their PhD will be able to stay for three years.
Read more on this and other visa related information 
here .CAREER AND 
EMPLOYABILITY 
During your studies, there will be 
an opportunity for you to develop critical thinking skills, creativity and confidence that employers look for.
There may also be the chance for 
you to get involved in internships, work-placements, volunteering and dissertation placements. 
The QS global survey of graduate 
employers consistently shows that UK degrees are highly valued worldwide, with UK universities topping the QS employer reputation ranking.16GRADUATE ROUTE 
AND STUDENT ROUTE
What is the Graduate route and who are eligible for 
it? (and who are not, eg distance learning students, those who arrive after 6 april etc)
The Graduate Route is the UK’s new post-study work 
visa that will be available for graduates from eligible universities in the UK. It will be two years long (or three years for PHD students) and gives eligible students the right to work, or look for work, whilst in the UK. The university you study at has to be registered with the Home Office with a track record of compliance (you can check this on Gov.UK) and you have to be studying at undergraduate level or above. You won’t be able to apply for this visa from anywhere outside the UK, and dependants (e.g. spouses or children) can only apply for the Graduate Route if they are inside the UK with a valid Student Dependant visa also. Furthermore, you can only avail the Graduate Route once per individual – it won’t be possible to repeatedly switch from student visas to the Graduate Route, for example. The Covid concession allows for students who have commenced a course of study via distance learning, due to Covid-19, to be able to access the Graduate route provided they enter the UK prior to 06 April 2021 and complete their course within the UK. Further information on the type of course which will confer eligibility for the route will be published in due course.
From when does it come into effect and what about 
students affected by Covid 19 restrictions? 
It will be introduced in Summer 2021, and anyone who 
has a valid student visa (either the old Tier 4 visa or new Student Route visa) will be able to apply, if they are in the UK with a valid visa at the time of introduction and successfully complete an eligible degree course at undergraduate level or above. We do not currently have an exact date for implementation but students who started their course in Autumn 2020 – as well as other students for example undergraduate students who started their courses in 2018 or 2019 – may be able to benefit.
Relating to Covid-19, the UK Government has 
confirmed that students can study online for the duration of the 2020-21 academic year. As part of that, students will still be eligible for the Graduate Route as long as they are in the UK by 6 April 2021 and then complete their course inside the country.You may have a lot of questions 
about the benefits and eligibility for the Graduate Route and Student Route, read to know more. 
Harry Booty, UKVI International Communications 
Lead, UK Visas and Immigration answers most common questions about Graduate Route and Student Route.
Harry BootyUKVI International Communications LeadHome Office, UK Visas and ImmigrationBritish High Commission17What benefits do I get from the graduate route?
The new Graduate Route represents a fantastic 
improvement for international students, who will now get more time to work, or look for work, after their studies in the UK. You do not need to be sponsored (e.g. you do not need a job offer) and can work at any skill level for any salary. This gives you more flexibility to begin your career in the UK, start earning money and explore different avenues for employment in the UK, rather than being tied to a single employer. 
An important thing to note however is that it is a one-
time two year (or three year for PHD) visa only, and it doesn’t count towards settlement. To stay in the UK longer, or count time towards applying to permanently settle in the UK, you will be able to consider other routes – such as the Skilled Worker, Start Up, Innovator or other visa routes.
What is the student route and how does it affect 
students from south Asian countries
The new Student Route opened on 5 October 2020 
and replaced the old Tier 4 student route. All students applying for courses within the UK, who are aged 16 or over will apply for the new Student Route. This has similarities with the old route, for example around language and finance. However, it becomes simpler in several notable ways. Most importantly, students will be able to apply up to six months before their course starts if they are applying from outside the UK– meaning they can sort their visa in good time before they need to travel. Furthermore, it will be easier for students to extend their Student Route visa inside the UK, if they wish to continue their studies (e.g. opting to do a masters after completing an undergraduate course).
What are some tips to ensure I get my visa 
approved? (plug in genuine student lines?)
Our main advice is to apply as early as possible. It 
takes about three weeks to get a response on your visa application (though it may be possible to pay for Priority or Super Priority visa service to get a response quicker, depending on where you are).
Our second main point of advice is to check your visa 
application and supporting documents thoroughly before submitting. Sometimes people get rejected for not meeting our basic requirements – for example not having money for 28 days before applying or not supplying evidence of English language proficiency. Visiting GOV.UK or speaking to your university about the information needed and ensuring to meet this is a simple way to maximise your chances of success.
Finally, we’d say, don’t worry too much! The vast 
majority of applicants are successful, and genuine students have nothing to worry about from our visa process. It may be that we ask for further information or even an interview – however, if you are able to come along, talk to us fluently in English and explain your plans and intentions for studying in UK, you shouldn’t be troubled by the experience.Where can I apply for my visa and find out more?

Do I need to get an IELTS test for my UK student 
visa?
All students must be able to speak English to a high 
standard to be granted a Student visa. In official language, this to B2 standard under the Common European Framework of Reference to study at degree level or above or B1 level to study below degree level, or CEFR. In practice, this means high proficiency or near-fluency.
Whether students will be required to sit a IELTS test 
or not depends on the level of study that is being undertaken and the type of sponsor the study will be conducted at. Students studying below degree level must pass an IELTS test. For students studying at degree level or above UK universities do have discretion about how they test English, and may offer different options for you to show your English proficiency to them. This differs from institution to institution so it is best to check directly with your chosen university. However you prove your English will be shown on the Confirmation of Acceptance of Studies, which you need to apply for your visa. You will need to provide the evidence of English language ability that the CAS references as part of your visa application.

Mamulpet
Madhurya Manjunath Mamulpet received the British Council 70th Anniversary Scholarship to study MSc in Data Science and Computational Intelligence at Coventry University in 2018.She was handpicked to work on a project with Aston Martin and graduated with a job as Data Scientist in the health service sector in UK. It all started in the final year of her bachelor’s degree where she aspired to pursue a career in the field of artificial intelligence.  When she first arrived in the UK, there was a drastic change in her environment and surroundings. However, universities and student organisations make it easier by organising a lot of welcome events and get-togethers which provides a splendid opportunity to socialise and make new friends.
She was well-aware of the economic requirements 
that one needed to pursue a master’s degree in the UK which led her to learn about the British Council’s Scholarship programme for women in STEM. This journey has been great from the very first day. It was hard to believe that all this was happening until she sat at her first lecture in the university this is when she realised how grateful she was to the British council.

INDIA
Sivaranjani 
Sivaranjani , Sivaranjani, 26, describes her experience 
of living and studying in the UK as ‘eye opening’. 
Graduated in computer science from the National Institute of Technology, soaked up every opportunity to learn and experience a diverse and multicultural 
life in King’s College, London. But what struck her the most was the sense of social consciousness that she observed everywhere in the UK. In addition to her core classes, Sivaranjani also embraced the King’s College cultural experience, joining a ten-week long module on theatre, dance, music, and museums, learning to do critical analysis of art. She even joined a class to learn Spanish and took on new hobbies like playing dungeons and dragons.
Despite her hectic schedule, Sivaranjani joined the

Sivaranjani now works as a software engineer, at a tech consultancy firm called Thought Works, in London. Says she “there is an extraordinary emphasis on work-life balance. I constantly get feedback from peers and superiors. So, you look at this as something you can learn from and it reduces competitiveness. Women in STEM often experience the ‘imposter syndrome’, a feeling that you don’t deserve to be here. But the feedback helps to dispel this.”

22I met Banari while I was doing my Master’s in 
Development Economics at UEA. It turned out that we were from neighbouring villages in Balochistan and that our families knew each other. It was the beginning of a life-long friendship; we never lost touch after that.  
Fast forward to the dramatic outbreak of COVID-19, 
which shocked the entire world to its core. Pakistan was no exception with the epicentre of the crisis being Balochistan.  
Banari and I got to discussing how we could help those 
less fortunate and in need and took it upon ourselves, without realising how big it could get.  
What started as messages between us quickly became 
a reality. People who knew us or heard what we were doing started supporting us. In less than two weeks we raised almost £5,000 and our 20 volunteers have already served more than 200 households with monthly ration bags. These bags provide a family of four with a month’s supply of food. We aim to support 5,000 families. 
Many areas in our native Balochistan are some of the 
most inaccessible areas of Pakistan due to challenging terrain and the insufficient infrastructure. But the fact that we two and all our friends and volunteers are natives of this land means that we’ve managed to reach these areas.  
Along with organising ration drives, we aim to provide 
more than 500 healthcare workers with protective gear and face shields. 
Keeping everyone involved safe is important and our 
team and volunteers follow strict protocols. Wearing gloves and masks is mandatory and we do not hand over ration bags to anyone but keep them at a distance for them to pick it up. 
The COVID-19 pandemic is a truly global crisis, but 
volunteers can make a huge difference to local communities. The poorest in society are often those who are hit hardest by self-isolating, and I would encourage all those who can to reach out to their neighbours and local citizens. The pandemic may be an awful event, but it can also be a fantastic showcase of the very best of humanity and togetherness.  
The UEA community is a family. We can all inspire each 
other with how we are responding to this crisis.

KFull Page Ad - Scholarship.pdf   1   06-11-2020   12:38:063Greetings from the British Council. 
I am delighted to present this Studying STEM in the UK 
magazine 2020 for students from South Asia who are 
interested in accessing these courses in the UK in coming 
months.
The United Kingdom offers you a world-leading education 
system, with accredited UK qualifications that can make 
a real difference to your career. With an outstanding 
reputation for research and higher education, UK 
universities and colleges attract the world’s leading 
academics and industry professionals. Studying in the UK 
will also give you the unique opportunity to experience 
a new and vibrant culture, network with students and 
professionals from all over the world and gain valuable 
skills to help further your professional development. 
The UK has a special place in the history of STEM. From 
Isaac Newton to Charles Darwin, Rosalind Franklin and 
Stephen Hawking, the UK has been globally recognised 
throughout history for our innovation, pioneering new 
ideas, technologies and research. Many breakthrough 
discoveries in STEM have taken place here, including 
the structure of DNA, the identification of the electron, 
the development of penicillin, and the advent of new 
materials such as graphene. 
The UK Government has also recently announced the 
Graduate Route which will enable international students 
to remain in the UK for two years (three years for PhD 
graduates) after they have completed their degrees. 
Students applying now to graduate in the summer of 2021 
or after will be eligible for this.
This publication will help you understand more about 
studying STEM in the UK, how STEM subjects are 
approached at universities and colleges, what sort of 
career paths you can pursue as well as useful information 
around student visas and IELTS. Some alumni profiles in 
the publication will give you an idea of what to expect 
and we hope this information gives you the confidence to 
pursue your dreams in the key area of STEM subject areas 
in the UK. There are some featured university profiles 
which can be useful but do remember that there are 
thousands of STEM courses and degrees available across 
many UK universities and colleges and you can find out 
more about.them, compare and study various institution profiles and 
offers here . 
In the academic year 2018-19, there were almost 40,000 
students from South Asia studying in the UK, where 
the outstanding contribution that students from India, 
Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal make to the 
international student community is greatly valued. 
I sincerely hope that this STEM publication can help you 
further your education plans and I wish you every success 
in making the most of your opportunity to study in the 
UK. Please reach out to your local British Council office for 
any queries or support. Good Luck and Bon Voyage!

rankings ever since they began. In 2018 the Times 
Higher Education World Rankings honoured us with 
three of the world’s top ten universities, including the 
top two – the University of Oxford and the University of 
Cambridge . This high quality can be found right across 
the country, with seven in the top 50 and 32 in the top 
200 universities. 
Quality that’s government-guaranteed
The UK’s 162 higher education institutions are all held to strict standards by the government, so you 
know you are getting the best teaching, support and 
resources available.
The Register of Regulated Qualifications contains 
details of Recognised Awarding Organisations and 
Regulated Qualifications in England (Ofqual), Wales 
(Welsh Government) and Northern Ireland (Ofqual for 
vocational qualifications and CCEA Accreditation for all 
other qualifications). For Scottish qualifications, please

career an edge.
Short, flexible courses
In the UK, flexibility is built into the majority of our 
courses. Many universities allow you to choose from 
different subject ‘modules’, so you can build a course 
programme that fits you best, specialising as you go 
for a perfectly tailored experience.
Postgraduate courses in the UK are shorter than both 
the US and Australia, with many MBA’s taking just one 
year. So you get better value for money and can begin 
applying your knowledge in the real world a lot sooner.
A new way of learning
Our educational system doesn’t just immerse you 
in your chosen subject – it’s designed to help you to 
think differently. Throughout your studies you’ll be 
encouraged to ask questions, debate your teachers 
and fellow students, and come up with your own ideas 
through a blend of practical learning, lectures and 
seminars and innovative, high-tech teaching.
Behind our courses and degrees are brilliant thinkers, 
some of the best minds in their fields who you can 
connect with.
The impact that their supportive inspiring teaching 
has is evident in the feedback we receive from 
our postgraduates. 93 per cent of international 
postgraduates rate the quality of UK teaching highly.  World-leading research
We’re ranked second in the world for science and 
research and 54 per cent of our output is world-
leading. Our field-weighted citation impact is higher 
than the US, Canada, Germany, Japan and Brazil, so 
when you study here you can be sure you’ll be working 
alongside some of the best minds – and using some of 
the best technology-  in the world.
Health and safety
The UK is a very safe country with low levels of crime 
and violence. Your university/institution will brief you 
about keeping safe and staff are always on hand to 
help ensure your safety. Community police officers 
and campus-based security staff will give you practical 
advice about personal safety.
The UK’s National Health Service (NHS) is one of the 
most advanced healthcare systems in the world. The 
NHS provides first-class treatment and support and 
you can access the NHS at a subsidised rate which is 
why international students do not need private medical 
insurance.
As part of your visa application, you will pay an 
Immigration Health Surcharge that allows you to 
use the NHS for most physical and mental illnesses, 
including emergency services and care for Covid.

STUDYING IN 
THE UK IN 20219Here in the UK, a warm welcome is awaiting

be regularly reviewed in line with current and local 
guidance to ensure teaching is delivered in a safe 
environment. In the UK, your wellbeing comes first. 
As an international student, please stay 
in touch with the institution you are 
interested in studying at for the latest 
information and support.
We want you to feel welcome and at ease when you 
arrive in the UK and would like to reassure all current 
and prospective students that UK universities are 
looking forward to welcoming you. 
UK universities are committed to supporting all 
students, including international students already in 
the UK, as well as those considering studying in the 
UK from January 2021 and beyond. If you have any 
concerns about the support you are receiving or are

Blended learning
Large audience teaching (lectures) will be delivered 
online, in cases supported by online discussions and 
face-to-face study in small groups will be made safer 
through ‘bubbles’. Courses with practical teaching 
sessions will be delivered in a safe way with physical 
distancing and personal protective equipment.Many UK institutions are developing exciting and 
innovative examples of high-quality online learning. 
Tier 4 sponsors can sponsor international students for 
blended learning for the 2020-21 academic year.
Health and well-being:
The health and wellbeing of international students 
is our number one priority and UK universities are 
working to ensure that they are safe and supported.
A programme ensuring mental health support for 
students during Covid-19 has been created by Student 
Minds, the UK’s mental health charity for students. 
Universities are putting measures in place to make sure 
campuses are clean and completely compliant with 
government guidelines. The UK government provided 
Covid-19 guidance for cleaning of non-healthcare 
settings, covering student accommodation and other 
spaces within the community. The timing of teaching is 
being carefully considered with flexible timetabling to 
avoid too many students on campus.
For full information, check your university or 
institution’s website as plans may change, depending 
on the current public health advice.
Letter to prospective International 
students:
Here’s what the Education and Universities Ministers 
of the four countries of the United Kingdom (UK), 
England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have to 
say to the prospective International students.
10The academic year
In the UK, the standard academic year starts in 
September or October and runs until June or July.
Postgraduate courses often run from September to 
September, and there are other courses that are more 
flexible and offer a range of start dates.  
Subjects and modules
Most higher education courses have a ‘modular’ 
structure. This means that you can build a personalised 
course by choosing modules or units of study from 
different subject areas. For example, if you are 
studying English literature, for your first year you could 
choose one module on Science fiction, one module on 
Children’s literature, and one module on Short stories.
If you are interested in more than one subject, you may 
be able to study a combination as part of your course, 
e.g. English literature and psychology. You can often 
decide for yourself how much time you would like to 
spend on each subject. ‘Joint’ means the two subjects 
are studied equally, ‘major/minor’ means the time 
spent is usually 75 per cent/25 per cent.  
Study modes
Most full-time undergraduate courses take three years 
to complete (typically four years in Scotland). Full-time 
postgraduate courses can be from one year upwards.
Some degrees are available to study as accelerated 
courses taken over two years instead of three, so that 
you can gain your qualification even faster. Accelerated 
degrees have the same amount of modules as their 
three year options, allowing you to get even better 
value for money by getting the same course with a 
year less of living cost.
Part-time courses are normally taken over a longer 
period, so that you can work alongside your studies 
or learn at a more relaxed pace. If you need a visa to 
study in the UK, please check that your immigration 
status allows you to do a part-time course.

subject offerings in the world.

Having a form of work placement experience definitely 
gives you an advantage in an increasingly competitive 
graduate job market.
Some courses include a year of working in the industry 
or internships in the industry you’re interested in. Work 
placements provide you with hands-on experience in 
a profession that you can’t simulate in lectures or the 
classroom.

The Graduate Market in 2020,  
High Fliers Research16GRADUATE ROUTE 
AND STUDENT ROUTE
What is the Graduate route and who are eligible for 
it? (and who are not, eg distance learning students, 
those who arrive after 6 april etc)
The Graduate Route is the UK’s new post-study work 
visa that will be available for graduates from eligible 
universities in the UK. It will be two years long (or three 
years for PHD students) and gives eligible students the 
right to work, or look for work, whilst in the UK. The 
university you study at has to be registered with the 
Home Office with a track record of compliance (you 
can check this on Gov.UK) and you have to be studying 
at undergraduate level or above. You won’t be able to 
apply for this visa from anywhere outside the UK, and 
dependants (e.g. spouses or children) can only apply 
for the Graduate Route if they are inside the UK with a 
valid Student Dependant visa also. Furthermore, you 
can only avail the Graduate Route once per individual – 
it won’t be possible to repeatedly switch from student 
visas to the Graduate Route, for example. The Covid 
concession allows for students who have commenced 
a course of study via distance learning, due to Covid-19, 
to be able to access the Graduate route provided they 
enter the UK prior to 06 April 2021 and complete their 
course within the UK. Further information on the type 
of course which will confer eligibility for the route will 
be published in due course.
From when does it come into effect and what about 
students affected by Covid 19 restrictions? 
It will be introduced in Summer 2021, and anyone who 
has a valid student visa (either the old Tier 4 visa or 
new Student Route visa) will be able to apply, if they are 
in the UK with a valid visa at the time of introduction 
and successfully complete an eligible degree course 
at undergraduate level or above. We do not currently 
have an exact date for implementation but students 
who started their course in Autumn 2020 – as well as 
other students for example undergraduate students 
who started their courses in 2018 or 2019 – may be able 
to benefit.
Relating to Covid-19, the UK Government has 
confirmed that students can study online for the 
duration of the 2020-21 academic year. As part of that, 
students will still be eligible for the Graduate Route 
as long as they are in the UK by 6 April 2021 and then 
complete their course inside the country.You may have a lot of questions 
about the benefits and eligibility for 
the Graduate Route and Student 
Route, read to know more. 
Harry Booty, UKVI International Communications 
Lead, UK Visas and Immigration answers most 
common questions about Graduate Route and 
Student Route.
Harry Booty
UKVI International Communications Lead
Home Office, UK Visas and Immigration
British High Commission17What benefits do I get from the graduate route?
The new Graduate Route represents a fantastic 
improvement for international students, who will now 
get more time to work, or look for work, after their 
studies in the UK. You do not need to be sponsored 
(e.g. you do not need a job offer) and can work at any 
skill level for any salary. This gives you more flexibility 
to begin your career in the UK, start earning money 
and explore different avenues for employment in the 
UK, rather than being tied to a single employer. 
An important thing to note however is that it is a one-
time two year (or three year for PHD) visa only, and it 
doesn’t count towards settlement. To stay in the UK 
longer, or count time towards applying to permanently 
settle in the UK, you will be able to consider other 
routes – such as the Skilled Worker, Start Up, Innovator 
or other visa routes.
What is the student route and how does it affect 
students from south Asian countries
The new Student Route opened on 5 October 2020 
and replaced the old Tier 4 student route. All students 
applying for courses within the UK, who are aged 16 
or over will apply for the new Student Route. This has 
similarities with the old route, for example around 
language and finance. However, it becomes simpler 
in several notable ways. Most importantly, students 
will be able to apply up to six months before their 
course starts if they are applying from outside the UK– 
meaning they can sort their visa in good time before 
they need to travel. Furthermore, it will be easier for 
students to extend their Student Route visa inside the 
UK, if they wish to continue their studies (e.g. opting 
to do a masters after completing an undergraduate 
course).
What are some tips to ensure I get my visa 
approved? (plug in genuine student lines?)
Our main advice is to apply as early as possible. It 
takes about three weeks to get a response on your 
visa application (though it may be possible to pay for 
Priority or Super Priority visa service to get a response 
quicker, depending on where you are).
Our second main point of advice is to check your visa 
application and supporting documents thoroughly 
before submitting. Sometimes people get rejected 
for not meeting our basic requirements – for example 
not having money for 28 days before applying or not 
supplying evidence of English language proficiency. 
Visiting GOV.UK or speaking to your university about 
the information needed and ensuring to meet this is a 
simple way to maximise your chances of success.
Finally, we’d say, don’t worry too much! The vast 
majority of applicants are successful, and genuine 
students have nothing to worry about from our visa 
process. It may be that we ask for further information 
or even an interview – however, if you are able to come 
along, talk to us fluently in English and explain your 
plans and intentions for studying in UK, you shouldn’t 
be troubled by the experience.Where can I apply for my visa and find out more?

Do I need to get an IELTS test for my UK student 
visa?
All students must be able to speak English to a high 
standard to be granted a Student visa. In official 
language, this to B2 standard under the Common 
European Framework of Reference to study at degree 
level or above or B1 level to study below degree level, 
or CEFR. In practice, this means high proficiency or 
near-fluency.
Whether students will be required to sit a IELTS test 
or not depends on the level of study that is being 
undertaken and the type of sponsor the study will 
be conducted at. Students studying below degree 
level must pass an IELTS test. For students studying 
at degree level or above UK universities do have 
discretion about how they test English, and may 
offer different options for you to show your English 
proficiency to them. This differs from institution to 
institution so it is best to check directly with your 
chosen university. However you prove your English 
will be shown on the Confirmation of Acceptance of 
Studies, which you need to apply for your visa. You 
will need to provide the evidence of English language 
ability that the CAS references as part of your visa 
application.

INDIA
…. on the way to their house 
on my two-wheeler scooter, 
my mother screamed out, 
on the road, to the world at 
large, that I have received the 
scholarship and I will be going 
to UK to study.Malvika Mehta
 
Malvika Mehta , 25 is from Maharashtra. During her 
second year of Bachelors in Ayurvedic Medicine and 
Surgery, she attended a course on forensic science and 
toxicology. The subject piqued her interest enough to 
make her decide to pursue it further. She applied to 
a number of universities around the world to pursue 
further education in Forensic Science. She finally heard 
from the British Council and from her most preferred 
Cranfield University at Bedfordshire. For Malvika, the 
timing of the scholarship was apt. She completed her 
course from Bharti Vidyapeeth College of Ayurveda in 
Pune in 2018 and in the same year went to the UK to 
study further. Her mother had to mortgage their house 
to raise funds, and she had already paid the deposit 
for the course. The scholarship from the British Council 
helped ease the burden of debt significantly.
Malvika enjoyed her stay in UK, she actively built 
networks with other scholarship recipients like the 
Chevening scholars. Friends, academics and the university also helped her build good connects. 
September 2018, when she started her course, 
following advice of the university, she started applying 
for jobs. She said, “ I applied for 388 jobs in 13 months! 
There is restriction in UK and US around confidentiality 
and security vetting for working on forensics. Without 
the vetting one requires three years of residency and that 
comes with a job. ” Eventually she came back to India. 
She worked with the Pune police and is also designing 
and delivering training modules on forensics. The 
experience of studying and living in UK has increased 
her confidence and given a sense of agency. She 
is currently working as a freelancer and has some 
interesting assignments and contracts in hand. At the

Sarah Jabeen , 27, hails from the historic city of 
Lucknow. After completing her education at the Awadh 
Girls Degree College in Lucknow, Sarah set her sights 
on a master’s degree outside her city. However, much 
to her disappointment, she was unable to secure 
admission anywhere, forcing her to drop that year 
and start working. A year later, she tried again and 
went on to join a two-year Master’s programme in 
Early Childhood Development at the prestigious Jamia 
Milia Islamia in Delhi. Sarah then returned to Lucknow 
and took up a job as a school counsellor. But she 
always dreamed of studying further, Sarah started 
researching courses at universities in the US and the 
UK, she applied to universities in the UK. However, she 
was adamant that she would take up any admission 
offer only if she received a scholarship, or if she was 
able to pay for it herself. So, when she received the 
offer of a full scholarship from the British Council, her 
joy knew no bounds. Since that joyful day in February 
2018, Sarah has gone on to study in the UK at the 
Bangor University.
The one year that Sarah spent in the UK gave 
her exposure to a world-class education and the 
opportunity to experience a new and diverse 
culture. At the university, she worked part time as an 
International Student Ambassador, supporting the 
university in the recruitment of international students. 
Sarah said that this helped her develop her abilities ‘to 
lead and to be led’. “ When something comes to you with 
difficulty, you value it more. One year was a short time, 
and I wanted to make the most of the time I had ”, says 
Sarah.
In addition to her academic and her job as an 
International Student Ambassador, she was part of the 
dissertation committee for the School of Psychology 
at her university. These experiences gave her the 
opportunity to build her self-confidence, leadership 
qualities, and grow as a person. Being a recipient 
of this scholarship has increased Sarah’s standing 
among her friends and family. Though her family was 
always supportive of women’s education, the fact that 
she got a full scholarship from the British Council to 
study in the UK, made her go up in their estimation 
substantially. Sarah speaks with delight of how excited 
her family was when they learned that she had met 
the then Prime Minister Teresa May. Without the 
scholarship, Sarah says, “I could not have experienced 
all this. I would still have been in Lucknow, working as a 
school counsellor ”.Who would have thought that 
I will have friends from Ghana, 
Egypt and Spain? We lived 
together and grew very close. 
Our shared accommodation was 
our home and we were a family.

27Varun Kumar
Varun Kumar is a former postgraduate from 
University of Bath originally from Chennai, India. He 
secured the British Council Great Scholarship 2019 to 
pursue his MSc in Robotics and Autonomous System. 
Even in times of COVID, Varun was successful in 
securing a graduate job in the U.K and is currently 
a Robotics Engineer at the United Kingdom Atomic 
Energy Authority – Culham Centre for Fusion Energy, 
working towards the application of robotics in nuclear 
fusion and contributing towards a greener and 
sustainable future.
“I graduated with First Class and Distinction from 
University of Bath, Bath is a beautiful city in the county of 
Somerset with rich heritage and architectural significance. 
I always believe “Hard work never fails” and I’m fortunate 
to now work in a UK government research organisation 
responsible for the development of nuclear fusion power.”
Having set my aspiration to study in the U.K, the Great 
Scholarship greatly helped me realise my dreams and 
reduced my financial burden entering the U.K. I started 
my studies in September 2019 and as common as it 
may sound, it took me some time to settle down to 
the culture, food habits, location of essential shops 
and especially the British weather which is highly 
unpredictable. Having a mental preparation during 
winter where it gets dark at 4.00pm in the evening is 
something to bear in mind. However, I soon began 
to get a grasp of things and once I managed to find 
a balance between my academic and social life, my 
student life became far more engaging.
As Robotics is a blooming field the course structure 
was very appealing as it had more scope for 
practical application of theoretical concepts through 
group projects and lab sessions. I had a wonderful 
opportunity to become a Student Ambassador for my 
course which helped me get to better know my fellow 
peers and get their feedback on their experience. I was 
fortunate to spend my first semester with no COVID 
interruptions, However the major lockdown in March 
2020 meant that my entire second semester shifted 
towards online learning. Even at such hard times, the 
University didn’t comprise in its educational quality and 
made the transition to online lectures much smoother. 
Apart from attending lectures and writing reports, 
spending time to indulge in extra-curricular activities 
is often encouraged in any University. Another thing I 
was looking forward to was attending university career 
fairs where you get an opportunity to stand out and 
directly talk to recruiters from various industries.
Living abroad has not only helped me gain the much-
needed educational exposure but also helped me 
become more independent, making me more self-
sufficient in standing my decisions. I also found that 
getting a part-time job after my class hours helped in 
managing my daily expenses and manage my time 
effectively. I believe these are key things to develop 
within an individual moving forward from a university 
life to a professional career.
I would also insist prospective future students to start 
applying for jobs once they start their studies in the 
U.K and work towards expanding their network. For 
instance, using platforms like LinkedIn to approach 
companies and recruiters greatly helped me in 
knowing current trends in my field. The STEM field 
in U.K is rapidly growing and there is plethora of 
opportunities to secure a job having the desired skill 
set and attitude. Having worked in the U.K. I learnt 
a lot right from personal development to having the 
confidence to raise questions and share my ideas in 
meetings.  On the whole, my experience in U.K was 
truly inspiring and I’m glad to have made the decision 
to come here and start my career. 
“Varun is determined to use the academic and professional 
experience in Robotics in the U.K to work towards solving 
issues related to climate change and help decarbonize the 
earth.”I graduated with First Class and 
Distinction from University of 
Bath, Bath is a beautiful city in 
the county of Somerset with 
rich heritage and architectural 
significance. I always believe “Hard 
work never fails” and I’m fortunate 
to now work in a UK government 
research organisation responsible 
for the development of nuclear 
fusion power.28
Yash Mehta 
I remember the day I got the offer letter to the 
University of Leeds; it’s become one of my greatest life 
experiences. I’ve recently graduated in MSc Advanced 
Computer Science and it was an honour to pursue my 
degree from a University which is not only a Russell 
Group University but also top 100 in the world*, top 
10 in the UK for research power* and has a diverse 
student population from around the world. The quality 
in teaching that I have received is truly reflected in their 
Gold award in the Teaching Excellence Framework*.
The School of Computing ranks in Top 10 in the UK*. 
The professors and tutors were well researched in 
their field with extensive teaching experience, but 
also approached students in a very friendly, patient 
and kind manner. They all had an open-door policy 
and were eager to help students reach their full 
protentional, academically and professionally. During 
projects, we had access to a wide range of specialist 
facilities and laboratories allowing practical experience 
with future technologies. The perfect blend of practical 
and theoretical knowledge throughout my degree, will 
leave a lasting imprint on me that I will carry onto my 
future careers. 
One of my favourite social aspects was the Leeds 
University Union (LUU), which is run by students for 
students. It has over 300 clubs and societies, ranging 
from cultural, religious or sports! It was the perfect 
way to meet new friends and bridge cultures from 
around the world. Along with the societies, I found 
part time jobs to enhance my experience through 
‘JobLink’ and received support for my future career at 
the Career Centre. From STEM specific career fairs to 
1-1 counselling, I feel confident and prepared into my 
future career.  
My time studying, making new friends and exploring 
a new me at the University of Leeds has been a life-
transforming journey and I can never be thankful 
enough to the community on campus and the city.

Co–founder of Kipple
“We want to question the very inevitability of 
waste” 
I am from India and I went to UEA to study 
Environmental Assessment and Management. But 
since UEA is very flexible on what you can study, I 
decided to do a module in international development 
where I met Jana and we instantly became friends.
One day we were walking around campus and came 
across all these piles of things the students had left 
behind or thrown away even though almost all, maybe 
85% of what was there was all perfectly usable.
That’s when ‘Kipple’ was born. Kipple creates 
‘shareable, sustainable starter kits for students’. Kipple 
rents these kits out, collects them when they’re no 
longer needed, has them professionally refurbished 
and then re-rents them, reducing the amount of waste 
generated.UEA is one of the few universities that has resources 
for graduates to use up to five years after graduation 
and that is the support we received from the Enterprise 
Centre at UEA. This support has been the key in helping 
us go strength to strength.
We wouldn’t be where we are without it. There’s 
funding, which we’ve benefited from – the ‘Grow It’ 
£7,500 grant from the UEA Enterprise Fund. But just 
as important is the mentorship, resources, confidence 
building, and help creating networks in the community 
which UEA provided with. We have a lot that we’ve 
been able to access studying at UEA.
I learned to think systematically about a situation and 
decide if a risk is significant or not and then work out 
how to mitigate it. I didn’t think that way before. And 
now everything I think about I do it that way. That 
would be finance, risk analysts, market research. When 
you run an enterprise, every day is a new day; I’ve used 
the skills I learnt in my degree every day.
The skills I learnt during my 
masters have helped me in 
business...

Dr. Asha de Vos31Istiaque Ahmed
Architect Istiaque Ahmed is currently based at Delft, 
in the Netherlands, where he is pursuing his PhD in 
Architecture at Delft University of Technology (TU 
Delft). Before joining here Istiaque served as a full-
time faculty member in several public and private 
universities in Bangladesh and also worked under the 
eminent Dhaka based architect Saif Ul Haque.
As an architect, Istiaque’s research and practice focus 
on informal urbanisation, socio-environmental justice, 
urban risk, and participatory methodologies of design. 
He has undertaken action-research, training and 
capacity building at various levels and worked closely 
with communities to devise strategies towards socio-
environmentally just urbanisation.Istiaque completed 5 years of professional Bachelor 
of Architecture (B.Arch) degree in 2012 from Khulna 
University, Bangladesh securing 1st position in merit. 
Subsequently, in 2016, he obtained MSc Degree with 
Merit from The Bartlett, University College London 
(UCL) under the Commonwealth Scholarship in UK 
scheme. 
The masters in an esteemed university like UCL 
provided top-notch education along with a unique 
opportunity of gathering experience in a global city 
like London. The overwhelming experience of UK 
life, the challenges and encounters of a demanding 
master’s degree facilitated Istiaque’s professional 
transformation and made him capable in research 
based design. Additionally, from the more academic 
point of view, the degree empowered Mr Istiaque to 
think beyond the conventional architectural domain 
and facilitated with necessary theoretical and hands-
on knowledge in order to integrate cultural, social, 
economic, political and spatial factors in the design 
process. In developing countries like Bangladesh 
such context specific and problem oriented design 
responses are extremely necessary particularly 
tackling the future challenges of climate change in the 
cities. However, at present, massive inadequacies of 
research driven architectural practice are apparent and 
Istiaque holds a vision to put a meaningful contribution 
in this specific sector utilising his past academic and 
professional experiences. 
After completing PhD Istiaques’ career ambition is 
to establish a design research platform for providing 
technical support not only to the key stakeholders but 
also to the disadvantaged communities in order to 
achieve a just and equitable future.

A Doctor of Philosophy, or doctorate (PhD/DPhil), is the highest academic 
level a student can achieve. These degrees are very demanding and often 
lead to careers in academia (as a lecturer or researcher). Most students will 
complete a master’s degree before they do a PhD.PhDs or doctorates
‘Postgrad’ certificates and diplomas allow students to study something 
new or build on the skills and knowledge already gained during their 
undergraduate degree.
Postgraduate diplomas are usually shorter than a master’s and do not 
involve a thesis or dissertation. Postgraduate diplomas and qualifications
These qualifications help you improve or gain skills for specific jobs. Most 
awards involve practical training. This gives you the opportunity to 
experience a job first-hand.

application to study at a UK university. This document is your opportunity 
to explain why you would like to study your chosen subject, and to outline 
the skills and experience that make you well suited to this field.
Here are some tips to help you.
•  The course description on the university website will explain the qualities, 
    skills and experience it requires. Be sure to explain how you match each 
    of these requirements as you write your statement.
•  State why you are applying for the course. Be specific about which 
    aspects interest you most, and how you believe the course will help you 
    in your future ambitions.
•  As well as explaining why you are academically suited to the course, also 
    describe any work experience you may have – or any extra-curricular 
    activities you take part in.

annually, and typically an undergraduate degree course will last for three 
years. Medical degrees may cost more and many UK master’s degrees

and this should be the first place you go to ask about accommodation. 
Most institutions provide accommodation for international students in 
a hall of residence (either full-board or self-catering) or a self-catering 
shared house or flat. Space is usually limited, so applications for such 
accommodation should be made as soon as you have been accepted 
on your course and certainly before the required deadline.Living in the UK
Accommodation
The accommodation office at your institution may be able to help with 
this, too. The office may keep lists of private accommodation available 
in the area, and some offices may even help you arrange a booking.
The most usual type of private accommodation is a room in a house 
with shared facilities. Renting a furnished house or a flat is likely to be 
expensive, especially in city centres, and quite difficult to find. A good 
way of making this affordable is to share with other students. If you do 
this, make sure you agree beforehand on how you will share costs.Private accommodation

enjoy yourself.
The average weekly food shop for one costs around £20-30. Although

students on different budgets.
An increasing number of UK supermarkets offer international food 
products, so you will always be able to get together with friends and cook 
the food you love. And by living among people from all backgrounds and 
cultures, you can also try out many new and different cuisines.

The restaurant scene in the UK is thriving, and increasingly diverse. Pubs 
are also popular social destinations for many university and college 
students in the UK. You don’t have to drink alcohol to go to a pub – you 
will find lots of non-alcoholic drinks on offer, and many pubs also have 
food and entertainment such as karaoke, football match screenings, or 
pub quizzes (weekly events where you compete as a team).
Some of the world’s largest music venues and events are in the UK, such 
as the O2 Arena in London and the world-famous Glastonbury Festival, 
but many world-renowned artists and bands also play at UK universities 
and colleges, and small bars and cafés often host live music and dancing. 
Almost every town will have a cinema with films from around the world. 
Hollywood releases will be easy to find, but major cities also have cinemas 
specialising in foreign and independent films, and universities often have 
a student cinema that shows films on campus at student-friendly prices.
If you love sport, the UK offers a range of ways to explore your passion. 
We’re fanatical about every kind of sport here, and many of our athletes 
and clubs lead the world. Whether it’s global team sports, like football, or 
individual sports like athletics, you will find ways to compete in and 
celebrate the sports you care most about alongside your studies.Leisure time

layers so that you can put them on or take them off as the weather 
changes, and always carry an umbrella.
In summer, the average temperature ranges from 9–18 degrees Celsius 
(48–64 degrees Fahrenheit), although on occasion, it can reach above 
30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit) in a heatwave. 
In winter the average is between 2 and 7 degrees Celsius (36–45 degrees 
Fahrenheit), but temperatures can drop below 0 degrees Celsius (36 
degrees Fahrenheit). Most houses, buildings, trains and buses have good 
heating systems. In general, there is little difference between the regions 
of the UK, but you will experience more snow, rain and wind in northern 
and mountainous areas.
Most UK towns and cities have a large range of shops selling clothes to 
suit all styles and budgets. You will see all kinds of fashion at UK schools, 
colleges and universities, and almost anything goes. Students usually 
dress casually during the day – jeans and t-shirts are fine – and more 
smartly if you’re going out in the evening. Very few student bars and 
pubs have a dress code. 
Some courses require you to wear specialist clothing for health and safety. 
For example, if you are in a science laboratory, you may need to wear 
protective glasses and a white lab coat. Some universities will provide 
these, while others may require you to purchase your own.
The UK is a multi-cultural place and it is common for people to wear 
clothing associated with their culture and religion, for example a head 
scarf, kippah, turban, sari or long skirt. In major towns and cities, you will 
find specialist shops selling clothing from around the world, particularly 
Asian and Middle Eastern clothing.UK weather and clothing

AUTUMN
WINTERSUMMER SPRING
March to May
Spring in Britain starts on the first 
day of March and ends on the last 
day of May in the meteorological 
calendar. But from an astronomical 
point of view, spring usually begins 
at the vernal equinox, around March 
20 in the northern hemisphere.
 
As the Atlantic loses heat in autumn 
and winter, the humidity and heat 
in the atmosphere are reduced, so 
the weather in Britain is slightly dry 
in spring.
September to November
According to the weather calendar, autumn 
begins in September and ends in November. 
In astronomy, autumn begins around the 
autumnal equinox on September 22. Similar 
to the vernal equinox, during the autumnal 
equinox, the sun shines directly on the equator, 
day and night are almost equal, each for 12 
hours. But the spring equinox represents the 
end of severe winter, while the autumn 
equinox marks the gradual beginning of 
winter.
In Britain, autumn often brings unstable 
weather, and you can still feel the obvious 
coolness sooner or later. In the second half 
of this season, due to the depression of the 
Atlantic Ocean, Britain will also have rain and 
wind.December to February
The meteorological calendar divides winter into the 
period from December to February. In astronomy, 
winter begins at the winter solstice, that is, around 
December 22 in the northern hemisphere. The winter 
solstice is the shortest day of the year. When the sun is 
farthest from the south of the earth's equator, the 
earth's northern hemisphere will tilt, causing the 
reduction of solar heat. After the winter solstice, the 
days begin to lengthen. There are many ways to query the weather in Britain. First of all, your mobile phone has its own weather query tool around the world. Two more 
authoritative UK weather forecast networks are recommended here. One is the weather forecast of Met Office and the other is BBC Weather.
June to August
The British summer calendar includes three 
months in June, July and August, or according 
to the astronomical calendar, from the day of 
the summer solstice, it is generally around June 
21. The summer solstice is the time when the sun 
reaches the highest point in the sky, which is 
also the longest day of the year.

highlands and islands, the UK is beautiful, and exploring is a must. Its 
relatively small size and good transport links mean that you can see 
a lot while you are here. Some highlights include London with its 
fascinating history, iconic buildings, cutting-edge fashion, theatre and 
food; northern cities like Manchester and Liverpool, which are well 
known for their famous football clubs and great nightlife; Scotland’s 
stunning mix of wild beauty and buzzing cities; the stunning landscapes 
of Wales’ national parks; and the spectacular coastline of Northern 
Ireland.
